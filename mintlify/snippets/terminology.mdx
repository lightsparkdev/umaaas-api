There are several key entities in the Grid API: **Platform**, **Customers**, **Internal Accounts**, **External Accounts**, **Quotes**, **Transactions**, and **UMA Addresses**.

- A platform has many customers
- Customers can have multiple internal accounts (one per currency)
- Customers can have multiple external accounts (bank accounts)
- The platform has its own internal accounts separate from customers
- Transactions move money between internal accounts, external accounts, and UMA addresses
- Quotes define the parameters for creating transactions
- Each customer has one UMA address (optional)

## Platform

Your **platform** is you! It's the top-level entity that integrates with the Grid API. The platform:

- Has its own configuration (webhook endpoint, supported currencies, API tokens, etc.)
- Manages multiple customers and their accounts
- Can hold platform-owned internal accounts for settlement and liquidity management
- Acts as the integration point between your application and the Grid payment network

## Customers

**Customers** are your end users who send and receive payments through your platform. Each customer:

- Can be an individual or business entity
- Has a KYC/KYB status that determines their ability to transact. If you are a regulated financial institution, this will typically be `APPROVED` since you do the KYC/KYB yourself.
- Is identified by both a system-generated ID and optionally your platform-specific customer ID
- May have associated internal accounts and external accounts
- May have a unique **UMA address** (e.g., `$john.doe@yourdomain.com`). If you don't assign an UMA address when creating a customer, they will be assigned a system-generated one.

## Internal Accounts

**Internal accounts** are Grid-managed accounts that hold balances in specific currencies. They can belong to either:

- **Platform internal accounts** - Owned by the platform for settlement, liquidity, and float management
- **Customer internal accounts** - Associated with specific customers for holding funds

Internal accounts:
- Have balances in a single currency (USD, EUR, MXN, etc.)
- Can be funded via bank transfers or crypto deposits using payment instructions
- Are used as sources or destinations for transactions instantly 24/7/365
- Track available balance for sending payments or receiving funds

## External Accounts

**External accounts** are traditional bank accounts, crypto wallets, or other payment instruments connected to customers
for on-ramping or off-ramping funds. Each external account:

- Belongs to a specific customer or the platform
- Represents a real-world bank account (with routing number, account number, IBAN, etc.), wallet, or payment instrument
- Has an associated beneficiary (individual or business)
- Has a status indicating screening status (ACTIVE, PENDING, INACTIVE, etc.)
- Can be used as a destination for quote-based transfers or same currency transfers like withdrawals
- For pullable sources like a debit cards or ACH pulls, an external account can be used as a source for transfers-in to
  fund internal accounts or to fund cross-border transfers.

## Quotes

**Quotes** provide locked-in exchange rates and payment instructions for transfers. A quote:

- Specifies a source (internal account, customer ID, or UMA address) and destination (internal/external account or UMA address)
- Locks an exchange rate for a short period (typically 1-5 minutes) or can be immediately executed with the `immediatelyExecute` flag
- Calculates total fees and amounts for currency conversion
- Provides payment instructions for funding the transfer if needed
- Must be executed before it expires
- Creates a transaction when executed

## Transactions

**Transactions** represent completed or in-progress payment transfers. Each transaction:

- Has a type (INCOMING or OUTGOING from the platform's perspective)
- Has a status (PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED, etc.)
- References a customer (sender for outgoing, recipient for incoming) or a platform internal account
- Specifies source and destination (accounts or UMA addresses)
- Includes amounts, currencies, and settlement information
- May include counterparty information for compliance purposes if required by your platform configuration

Transactions are created when:
- A quote is executed (either incoming or outgoing)
- A same currency transfer is initiated (transfer-in or transfer-out)

## UMA Addresses

**UMA addresses** are human-readable payment identifiers that follow the format `$username@domain.com`. They:

- Uniquely identify entities on the Grid network
- Enable sending and receiving payments across different platforms without knowing the recipient's underlying account details or personal information
- Support currency negotiation and cross-border transfers
- Work similar to email addresses but for payments
- Are an optional UX improvement for some use cases. Use of UMA addresses is not required in order to use the Grid API.
