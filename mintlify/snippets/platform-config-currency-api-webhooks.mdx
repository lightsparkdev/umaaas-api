## Supported currencies
During onboarding, choose the currencies your platform will support. For prefunded models, Grid automatically creates perâ€‘currency accounts for each new customer. You can add or remove supported currencies anytime in the Grid dashboard.

## API credentials and authentication
Create API credentials in the Grid dashboard. Credentials are scoped to an environment (Sandbox or Production) and cannot be used across environments.

- Authentication: Use HTTP Basic Auth with your API key and secret in the `Authorization` header.
- Keys: Sandbox keys only work against Sandbox; Production keys only work against Production.

<Tip>
Never share or expose your API secret. Rotate credentials periodically and restrict access.
</Tip>

### Example: HTTP Basic Auth in cURL

```bash
# Using cURL's Basic Auth shorthand (-u):
curl -sS -X GET "$GRID_BASE_URL/config" \
  -u "$GRID_API_KEY:$GRID_API_SECRET"

```

## Base API path

The base API path is consistent across environments; your credentials determine the environment.

Base URL: `https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13` (same for Sandbox and Production; your keys select the environment).

<Tip>
If you use an SDK, it manages request paths and authentication after you initialize it with your credentials.
</Tip>

## Webhooks and signature verification
Configure your webhook endpoint to receive payment lifecycle events. Webhooks use asymmetric (public/private key) signatures; verify each webhook using the Grid public key available in your dashboard.

- Expose a public HTTPS endpoint (for development, reverse proxies like ngrok can help). You'll also need to set your webhook endpoint in the Grid dashboard.
- When receiving webhooks, verify the `X-Grid-Signature` header against the exact request body using the dashboard-provided public key
- Process events idempotently and respond with 2xx on success

You can trigger a test delivery from the API to validate your endpoint setup. The public key for verification is shown in the dashboard; rotate and update it when instructed by Lightspark.

### Test your webhook endpoint
Use the webhook test endpoint to send a synthetic event to your configured endpoint.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$GRID_BASE_URL/webhooks/test" \
  -u "$GRID_API_KEY:$GRID_API_SECRET"
```

Example test webhook payload:

```json
{
  "test": true,
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "type": "TEST"
}
```
