When you first sign up for Grid, a platform will be created for you with preconfigured settings.
Use the `/config` endpoint to view and update your platform configuration for the Grid API.

## Retrieve Current Configuration

You can retrieve your current platform configuration to see what settings are already in place:


```bash cURL
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/config' \
  -u 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
```

```json Success
{
  "id": "PlatformConfig:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000003",
  "webhookEndpoint": "https://api.example.com/webhooks/grid",
  "supportedCurrencies": [
    {
      "currencyCode": "USD",
      "minAmount": 100,
      "maxAmount": 1000000,
      "enabledTransactionTypes": ["OUTGOING", "INCOMING"]
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2023-06-15T12:30:45Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-07-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

<Note>
If this is your first time configuring the platform, some default values may be returned which were set up when you first created your account.
</Note>

## Update Platform Configuration

To update your platform configuration for payouts payments, use the PATCH endpoint:


```bash cURL
curl -X PATCH 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/config' \
  -u 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "webhookEndpoint": "https://api.mycompany.com/webhooks/grid",
    "supportedCurrencies": [
      {
        "currencyCode": "USD",
        "minAmount": 100,
        "maxAmount": 1000000,
        "enabledTransactionTypes": ["OUTGOING", "INCOMING"],
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```json Success
{
  "id": "PlatformConfig:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000003",
  "webhookEndpoint": "https://api.mycompany.com/webhooks/grid",
  "supportedCurrencies": [
    {
      "currencyCode": "USD",
      "minAmount": 100,
      "maxAmount": 1000000,
      "enabledTransactionTypes": ["OUTGOING", "INCOMING"]
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2023-06-15T12:30:45Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-06-15T12:30:45Z"
}
```

Note that not all fields are patchable. If you need to update a field that is not patchable, please contact support.

<Warning>
The `webhookSecret` is not returned in the response. It can only be retrieved from the Grid dashboard. Store this securely as it's used to verify the authenticity of webhooks (see the [Webhook Verification Guide](/snippets/webhooks)).
</Warning>

## Configuration Parameters

### Webhook Endpoint

The `webhookEndpoint` parameter specifies the URL where Grid will send webhook notifications about payment events. Your webhook endpoint must:

- Be publicly accessible over HTTPS
- Respond with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Handle webhook verification (see [Webhook Verification Guide](/docs/webhooks))
- Process webhook payloads within a reasonable time (recommended: under 5 seconds)

### Supported Currencies

The `supportedCurrencies` array allows you to define settings for each currency your platform will support for payouts payments. Each object in this array can contain:

- `currencyCode`: (String, required) The ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., "USD").
- `minAmount`: (Integer, required) Minimum transaction amount in the smallest unit of the currency.
- `maxAmount`: (Integer, required) Maximum transaction amount in the smallest unit of the currency.
- `enabledTransactionTypes`: (Array, optional) Specifies which transaction types are allowed (e.g., `["OUTGOING", "INCOMING"]`).

<Note>
For payouts payments, you do not need UMA-specific fields like `providerRequiredCustomerFields` or `providerRequiredCounterpartyCustomerFields`. The configuration is simpler and focuses on basic currency requirements.
</Note>

## Verify Configuration

After updating your configuration, it's recommended to verify that the changes were saved correctly:

```bash cURL
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/config' \
  -u 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
```

<Warning>
PATCH may return 400 for validation errors, 401 for authentication issues, and 500/501 for server or unsupported operations.
</Warning>
