title: "Platform Configuration"
---

This guide explains how to configure your platform: get API credentials, set the base API path, configure webhooks, and set up UMA parameters and compliance settings.

## API credentials and authentication
Create API credentials in the Grid dashboard. Credentials are scoped to an environment (Sandbox or Production) and cannot be used across environments.

- Authentication: Use HTTP Basic Auth with your API key and secret in the `Authorization` header.
- Keys: Sandbox keys only work against Sandbox; Production keys only work against Production.

<Tip>
Never share or expose your API secret. Rotate credentials periodically and restrict access.
</Tip>

### Example: HTTP Basic Auth in cURL

```bash
# Using cURL's Basic Auth shorthand (-u):
curl -sS -X GET "$GRID_BASE_URL/config" \
  -u "$GRID_API_KEY:$GRID_API_SECRET"

```

## Base API path

The base API path is consistent across environments; your credentials determine the environment.

Base URL: `https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13` (same for Sandbox and Production; your keys select the environment).

<Tip>
If you use an SDK, it manages request paths and authentication after you initialize it with your credentials.
</Tip>

## Webhooks and signature verification
Configure your webhook endpoint to receive payment lifecycle events. Webhooks use asymmetric (public/private key) signatures; verify each webhook using the Grid public key available in your dashboard.

- Expose a public HTTPS endpoint (for development, reverse proxies like ngrok can help). You'll also need to set your webhook endpoint in the Grid dashboard.
- When receiving webhooks, verify the `X-Grid-Signature` header against the exact request body using the dashboard-provided public key
- Process events idempotently and respond with 2xx on success

You can trigger a test delivery from the API to validate your endpoint setup. The public key for verification is shown in the dashboard; rotate and update it when instructed by Lightspark.

### Test your webhook endpoint
Use the webhook test endpoint to send a synthetic event to your configured endpoint.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$GRID_BASE_URL/webhooks/test" \
  -u "$GRID_API_KEY:$GRID_API_SECRET"
```

Example test webhook payload:

```json
{
  "test": true,
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "type": "TEST"
}
```

For more details about webhooks like retry policy and examples, take a look at our [Webhooks](/developer-tools/webhooks) documentation.

## UMA configuration
If you want to send and receive to UMA addresses, you'll need to fill in your UMA configuration. Configuring UMA requires 3 steps:

1. configure your UMA domain
2. proxy inbound UMA requests to Lightspark Grid
3. define the currency you support and the counterparty information you require

### UMA Domain

The `umaDomain` parameter defines the domain part of all UMA addresses for your users. For example, if you set `umaDomain` to `mycompany.com`, your users' UMA addresses will follow the format `$username@mycompany.com`.

### Configuring UMA proxy requests
Configure your UMA domain and proxy UMAâ€‘related requests to your assigned `proxyUmaaasSubdomain`.

- UMA domain determines the address format (e.g., `$alice@yourdomain.com`)
- Proxy the following paths to `{proxyUmaaasSubdomain}`:
  - `https://<umaDomain>/.well-known/lnurlp/*` -> `https://<proxyUmaaasSubdomain>.umaaas.uma.money/.well-known/lnurlp/*`
  - `https://<umaDomain>/.well-known/lnurlpubkey` -> `https://<proxyUmaaasSubdomain>.umaaas.uma.money/.well-known/lnurlpubkey`
  - `https://<umaDomain>/.well-known/uma-configuration` -> `https://<proxyUmaaasSubdomain>.umaaas.uma.money/.well-known/uma-configuration`

Additionally, configure:
- Supported currencies (min/max, enabled transaction types)
- Required counterparty fields per currency for compliance screening


### Supported currencies

The `supportedCurrencies` array allows you to define settings for each currency your platform will support. Each object in this array can contain:

- `currencyCode`: (String, required) The ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., "USD").
- `minAmount`: (Integer, required) Minimum transaction amount in the smallest unit of the currency.
- `maxAmount`: (Integer, required) Maximum transaction amount in the smallest unit of the currency.
- `requiredCounterpartyFields`: (Array, required) Defines PII your platform requires about *external counterparties* for transactions in this currency.
- `umaProviderRequiredUserFields`: (Array, read-only) Lists user info field names (from `UserInfoFieldName`) that the UMA provider mandates for *your own users* to transact in this currency. This impacts user creation/updates.

### Required counterparty fields

Within each currency defined in `supportedCurrencies`, the `requiredCounterpartyFields` parameter allows you to specify what information your platform needs to collect from *external counterparties* (senders or receivers) involved in transactions with your users for that specific currency.

Available counterparty fields (to be specified with a `name` and `mandatory` flag):

| Field Name (type `UserInfoFieldName`) | Description |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| `FULL_NAME` | Full legal name of the individual or business |
| `BIRTH_DATE` | Date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format (for individuals) |
| `NATIONALITY` | Nationality of the individual |
| `ADDRESS` | Physical address including country, city, etc. |
| `PHONE_NUMBER` | Contact phone number including country code |
| `EMAIL` | Email address |
| `BUSINESS_NAME` | Legal business name (for business entities) |
| `TAX_ID` | Tax identification number |

Each field in `requiredCounterpartyFields` is an object containing:

- `name`: The `UserInfoFieldName` representing the PII you require.
- `mandatory`: A boolean (true/false) indicating if this field is strictly required by your platform for transactions in this currency.

This information will be provided to your platform via webhooks for pending payments, allowing you to screen the counterparty based on your compliance rules before approving the payment.

### UMA provider required user fields

Also within each currency defined in `supportedCurrencies`, you will find the `umaProviderRequiredUserFields` array. This is a **read-only** list of `UserInfoFieldName` strings.

This list specifies which user information fields are mandated by the underlying UMA provider for *your own registered users* if they intend to send or receive payments in that particular currency. For example, to allow a user to transact in "USD", the UMA provider might require that the user has a `NATIONALITY` on record.

These fields must be supplied when creating or updating a user via the `POST /users` or `PATCH /users/{userId}` endpoints if that user is expected to use the specified currency. Refer to the [Configuring Users](/docs/configuring-users) guide for more details on how this impacts user setup.

## Manage configuration via API
If you prefer to manage settings programmatically, use the `/config` endpoints.

### Retrieve current configuration

You can retrieve your current platform configuration to see what settings are already in place:

```bash
curl -sS -X GET "$GRID_BASE_URL/config" \
  -u "$GRID_API_KEY:$GRID_API_SECRET"
```

Response example:

```json
{
  "id": "PlatformConfig:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000003",
  "umaDomain": "example.com",
  "webhookEndpoint": "https://api.example.com/webhooks/uma",
  "supportedCurrencies": [
    {
      "currencyCode": "USD",
      "minAmount": 100,
      "maxAmount": 1000000,
      "requiredCounterpartyFields": [
        {
          "name": "FULL_NAME",
          "mandatory": true
        },
        {
          "name": "BIRTH_DATE",
          "mandatory": true
        }
      ],
      "umaProviderRequiredUserFields": [
        "NATIONALITY",
        "FULL_NAME"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2023-06-15T12:30:45Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-07-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

If this is your first time configuring the platform, some default values may be returned which were set up when you first created your account.

### Update platform configuration

To update your platform configuration, call the PATCH endpoint with the fields you want to change:

```bash
curl -sS -X PATCH "$GRID_BASE_URL/config" \
  -u "$GRID_API_KEY:$GRID_API_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "umaDomain": "mycompany.com",
    "webhookEndpoint": "https://api.mycompany.com/webhooks/uma",
    "supportedCurrencies": [
      {
        "currencyCode": "USD",
        "minAmount": 100,
        "maxAmount": 1000000,
        "requiredCounterpartyFields": [
          { "name": "FULL_NAME", "mandatory": true },
          { "name": "BIRTH_DATE", "mandatory": true },
          { "name": "ADDRESS", "mandatory": false }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "PlatformConfig:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000003",
  "umaDomain": "mycompany.com",
  "webhookEndpoint": "https://api.mycompany.com/webhooks/uma",
  "supportedCurrencies": [
    {
      "currencyCode": "USD",
      "minAmount": 100,
      "maxAmount": 1000000,
      "requiredCounterpartyFields": [
        {
          "name": "FULL_NAME",
          "mandatory": true
        },
        {
          "name": "BIRTH_DATE",
          "mandatory": true
        },
        {
          "name": "ADDRESS",
          "mandatory": false
        }
      ],
      "umaProviderRequiredUserFields": [
        "NATIONALITY",
        "FULL_NAME"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2023-06-15T12:30:45Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-06-15T12:30:45Z"
}
```




## Verify Configuration

After updating your configuration, it's recommended to verify that the changes were saved correctly:

```http
GET /config
```

The response should reflect your updated **settings**.
