# Receiving Payments

This guide outlines the process for platforms to receive payments from UMA addresses.

## Process Overview

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between your platform and the UMAaaS API when receiving payments:

```mermaid

    participant Sender as External Sender
    participant UMAaaS as UMAaaS API
    participant Client as Your Platform
    participant Bank as Banking Provider
    
    Note over Client, UMAaaS: One-time setup
    Client->>UMAaaS: PUT /config (set domain, webhook URL)
    UMAaaS-->>Client: Configuration saved
    Client->>UMAaaS: POST /users (register users with bank info)
    UMAaaS-->>Client: User registered
    
    Note over Sender, UMAaaS: Payment initiated by sender
    Sender->>UMAaaS: Initiates payment to UMA address
    UMAaaS->>Client: Webhook: INCOMING_PAYMENT (PENDING)
    
    alt Payment approved
        Client-->>UMAaaS: HTTP 200 OK (approve payment, provide PII if requested)
        UMAaaS->>Bank: Execute payment to user's bank account
        UMAaaS->>Client: Webhook: INCOMING_PAYMENT (COMPLETED)
        Client-->>UMAaaS: HTTP 200 OK (acknowledge completion)
    else Payment rejected
        Client-->>UMAaaS: HTTP 403 Forbidden with rejection reason
        UMAaaS->>Sender: Payment rejected notification
    end
```

The process consists of five main steps:

1. **Platform configuration** (one-time setup) to set your UMA domain and required counterparty fields
2. **Register users** with their bank account information so they can receive payments
3. **Set up webhook endpoints** to receive notifications about incoming payments
4. **Receive and approve/reject incoming payments** via webhooks
5. **Receive completion notification** when the payment completes

## Step 1: Platform configuration (one-time setup)

Configure your platform settings (if you haven't already in the onboarding process). See the [Platform Configuration](/docs/platform-configuration) guide for more details.

## Step 2: Register users with bank account information

First, register your users in the system so they can receive payments via UMA. You can optionally include a `platformAccountId` in the bank account information to link accounts with your internal systems.

```http
POST /users
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "umaAddress": "$john.receiver@thegoodbank.com",
  "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
  "userType": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "fullName": "John Receiver",
  "birthDate": "1985-06-15",
  "address": {
    "line1": "123 Pine Street",
    "line2": "Unit 501",
    "city": "Seattle",
    "state": "WA",
    "postalCode": "98101",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "bankAccountInfo": {
    "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
    "accountNumber": "123456789",
    "routingNumber": "987654321",
    "accountCategory": "CHECKING",
    "bankName": "Chase Bank",
    "platformAccountId": "chase_primary_1234"
  }
}
```

See the [Configuring Users](/docs/configuring-users) guide for more details.

## Step 3: Webhook setup (one-time setup)

Configure your webhook endpoints to receive notifications about incoming payments. You'll need to implement the webhook endpoints on your server. Remember to validate webhook signatures to ensure they are authentic. See the [Webhook Verification](/docs/webhooks) guide for more details.

## Step 4: Receive and approve incoming payments

When someone initiates a payment to one of your users' UMA addresses, you'll receive a webhook call with a pending transaction:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000005",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "type": "INCOMING",
    "senderUmaAddress": "$mary.sender@thelessgoodbank.com",
    "receiverUmaAddress": "$john.receiver@thegoodbank.com",
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 50000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "userId": "User:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
    "description": "Payment for services",
    "counterpartyInformation": {
      "FULL_NAME": "Mary Sender",
      "BIRTH_DATE": "1985-06-15"
    },
    "reconciliationInstructions": {
      "reference": "REF-123456789"
    }
  },
  "requestedReceiverUserInfoFields": [
    { "name": "COUNTRY_OF_RESIDENCE", "mandatory": true },
    { "name": "FULL_NAME", "mandatory": true },
    { "name": "NATIONALITY", "mandatory": false }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000007",
  "type": "INCOMING_PAYMENT"
}
```

The `counterpartyInformation` object contains PII about the *sender*, provided by their VASP. The `requestedReceiverUserInfoFields` array, if present, lists information fields that the sender's VASP (or governing regulations) require about your user (the *recipient*). UMAaaS does not have this information and is requesting it from your platform to proceed with the payment. Each item in this array is an object specifying the `name` of the field (from `UserInfoFieldName`) and whether it's `mandatory`.

You have two options for approving or rejecting the payment:

### Option 1: Synchronous Processing (Recommended)

To approve the payment synchronously, respond with a `200 OK` status:

- If the `requestedReceiverUserInfoFields` array was present in the webhook request and contained mandatory fields, your `200 OK` response **must** include a JSON body containing a `receiverUserInfo` object. This object should contain the key-value pairs for the information fields that were requested.
- If `requestedReceiverUserInfoFields` was not present, was empty, or contained only non-mandatory fields for which you have no information, your `200 OK` response can have an empty body.

Example `200 OK` response body when information was requested and provided:

```json
{
  "receiverUserInfo": {
    "COUNTRY_OF_RESIDENCE": "US",
    "FULL_NAME": "John Receiver"
  }
}
```

To reject the payment, respond with a 403 Forbidden status and a JSON body with the following fields:

```json
{
  "code": "payment_rejected",
  "message": "Payment rejected due to compliance policy",
  "details": {
    "reason": "failed_counterparty_check",
    "rejectionReason": "User is in a restricted jurisdiction"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Asynchronous Processing

If your platform's architecture requires asynchronous processing before approving or rejecting the payment, you can:

1. Return a `202 Accepted` response to acknowledge receipt of the webhook
2. Process the payment asynchronously
3. Call either the `/transactions/{transactionId}/approve` or `/transactions/{transactionId}/reject` endpoint *within 5 seconds*

Example of approving asynchronously:

```http
POST /transactions/Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000005/approve
```

Request body (if information was requested):

```json
{
  "receiverUserInfo": {
    "COUNTRY_OF_RESIDENCE": "US",
    "FULL_NAME": "John Receiver"
  }
}
```

Example of rejecting asynchronously:

```http
POST /transactions/Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000005/reject
```

Request body (optional):

```json
{
  "reason": "RESTRICTED_JURISDICTION"
}
```

> **Important**: If you choose the asynchronous path, you must call the approve/reject endpoint within 5 seconds, or the payment will be automatically rejected. The synchronous path (Option 1) is preferred where possible.

## Step 5: Receive completion notification

When the payment completes, your webhook endpoint will receive another notification:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000005",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "INCOMING",
    "senderUmaAddress": "$mary.sender@thelessgoodbank.com",
    "receiverUmaAddress": "$john.receiver@thegoodbank.com",
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 50000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "userId": "User:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
    "settledAt": "2023-08-15T14:30:00Z",
    "createdAt": "2023-08-15T14:25:18Z",
    "description": "Payment for services",
    "counterpartyInformation": {
      "FULL_NAME": "Mary Sender",
      "BIRTH_DATE": "1985-06-15"
    },
    "reconciliationInstructions": {
      "reference": "REF-123456789"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000007",
  "type": "INCOMING_PAYMENT"
}
```
