import { topLevelProductName } from '/snippets/variables.mdx'

{topLevelProductName} provides two environments: production and sandbox.  Both environments use the same base URL and API tokens are scoped to an environment.

## Base API URL
 `https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13`

## Sandbox
Sandbox enables you to test your integration without making real payments.  In sandbox, we expose sandbox specific APIs to trigger specific test cases like incoming payments.  Additionally you'll find test UMA addresses to simulate different sending scenarios.  For more information, see [Sandbox Testing](../remittances/developer-guides/sandbox-testing).

## Production
Production moves real money.  To get access to a production environment, please reach out to your Lightspark contact.
