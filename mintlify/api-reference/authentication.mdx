{topLevelProductName} API uses HTTP Basic Authentication with your client ID as the username and your client secret as the password.  
<Note>Your API tokens are scoped to either your production or sandbox environment.</Note>

```bash
curl -u "{client_id}:{client_secret}" https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13...
```

If integrating with one of our SDKs, the SDK reads environment variables and will populate the credentials for you.
