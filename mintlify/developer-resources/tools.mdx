Grid provides a set of tools to help you understand and test payment flows.

## UMA Test Wallet
The UMA Test Wallet is an external, dogfooded sandbox that demonstrates UMA payment flows end to end and gives you a realistic counterparty for development and QA. It helps you understand flows through hands-on interaction, explore recommended UX patterns, and develop against a live UMA VASP without setting up complex infrastructure.

<Info>
Purpose-built to: (1) build intuition for UMA flows, (2) showcase UX best practices for send and receive, and (3) act as a counterparty VASP for developers working on UMA Auth and UMA Invoice.

### What you can do
- **Experience UMA flows**: Send and receive payments using UMA handles with real-time feedback.
