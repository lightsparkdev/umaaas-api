## Filtering transactions

Use query parameters to filter and narrow down transaction results.

### Filter by customer

Get all transactions for a specific customer:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?customerId=Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

Or use your platform's customer ID:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?platformCustomerId=customer_12345' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

### Filter by transaction type

Get only incoming or outgoing transactions:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Outgoing Only">
```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?type=OUTGOING' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Incoming Only">
```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?type=INCOMING' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Filter by status

Get transactions in a specific status:

```bash
# Get all pending transactions
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?status=PENDING' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'

# Get all completed transactions
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?status=COMPLETED' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

**Available statuses:**

- `PENDING` - Transaction initiated, awaiting processing
- `PROCESSING` - Transaction in progress
- `COMPLETED` - Transaction successfully completed
- `FAILED` - Transaction failed
- `REJECTED` - Transaction rejected

### Filter by date range

Get transactions within a specific date range:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?startDate=2025-10-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2025-10-31T23:59:59Z' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

<Tip>Dates must be in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2025-10-03T15:00:00Z`).</Tip>

### Filter by account

Get transactions for a specific account:

```bash
# Any transactions involving this account (sent or received)
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?accountIdentifier=InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'

# Only transactions sent FROM this account
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?senderAccountIdentifier=InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'

# Only transactions sent TO this account
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?receiverAccountIdentifier=ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

## Combining filters

You can combine multiple filters to narrow down results:

```bash
# Get completed outgoing transactions for a customer in October 2025
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?customerId=Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001&type=OUTGOING&status=COMPLETED&startDate=2025-10-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2025-10-31T23:59:59Z' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

## Pagination

Handle large result sets with cursor-based pagination:

<Steps>
<Step title="Get first page">
```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?limit=20' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    /* 20 transactions */
  ],
  "hasMore": true,
  "nextCursor": "eyJpZCI6IlRyYW5z...",
  "totalCount": 150
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Get next page">
Use the `nextCursor` from the previous response:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?limit=20&cursor=eyJpZCI6IlRyYW5z...' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

</Step>

<Step title="Continue until done">
Keep paginating while `hasMore` is `true`. Continue making requests with the `nextCursor` value from each response until `hasMore` becomes `false`.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>The maximum `limit` is 100 transactions per request. Default is 20.</Info>

## Get a single transaction

Retrieve details for a specific transaction by ID:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions/Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000030' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Use pagination for large datasets">
Always implement pagination when fetching transactions to avoid timeouts and memory issues:

```javascript
// Good: Paginated approach
async function fetchWithPagination(filters) {
  const transactions = [];
  let cursor = null;

  do {
    const page = await fetchTransactionPage(filters, cursor);
    transactions.push(...page.data);
    cursor = page.nextCursor;
  } while (cursor);

  return transactions;
}

// Bad: Trying to fetch everything at once
async function fetchAll() {
  const response = await fetch("/transactions?limit=10000"); // Don't do this!
  return response.json();
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cache results when appropriate">
For data that doesn't change frequently (like completed transactions), implement caching in your application. Completed transactions are immutable, so they're safe to cache using a key like `{customerId}-{month}` to reduce API calls and improve performance.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use specific filters to reduce result sets">
Apply filters in the API query to get only the data you need, rather than fetching all transactions and filtering in your application code.

**Good approach:**
```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?status=FAILED&startDate=2025-10-01T00:00:00Z&type=OUTGOING' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

**Bad approach:** Fetching all transactions without filters and filtering in your application code. This wastes bandwidth and increases latency.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Handle rate limits gracefully">
Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors in your application. When you receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

1. Check the `Retry-After` header for the recommended wait time
2. Wait for the specified duration (in seconds)
3. Retry the request
4. Implement a maximum retry limit (e.g., 3 attempts) to prevent infinite loops

This ensures your application handles API rate limits gracefully without overwhelming the service.
