This guide provides comprehensive information about user configuration in the Grid API, including user types, registration processes, management, and bank account information.

## User Types

The Grid API supports both individual and business users. While the API schema itself makes most Personally Identifiable Information (PII) optional at the initial user creation, specific fields may become mandatory based on the currencies the user will transact with.

Your platform's configuration (retrieved via `GET /config`) includes a `supportedCurrencies` array. If a user is intended to use a specific currency, any fields listed in for that currency **must** be provided when creating or updating the user.

The base required information for all users is only:

- Platform user ID (your internal user identifier)
- User Type (`INDIVIDUAL` or `BUSINESS`)
- Bank account information (see below for supported formats)

### Individual Users

In some cases, only the above fields are required at user creation! Beyond those base requirements, additional fields commonly associated with individual users include:

- Full name
- Date of birth (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Physical address (including country, state, city, postalCode)

### Business Users

Beyond the base requirements, additional fields commonly associated with business users include:

- Business information:
  - Legal name
  - Registration number
  - Tax ID 
- Physical address (including country, state, city, postalCode)


When creating or updating users, the `userType` field must be specified as either `INDIVIDUAL` or `BUSINESS`. Depending if you are a regulated or unregulated platform your KYC/KYB requirements will vary. Check
out the [Quickstart Guide KYC/KYB section](/payouts/quickstart#choosing-your-onboarding-flow) for more information.

## User Registration Process

### Creating a New User

To register a new user in the system, use the `POST /users` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
    "userType": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "bankAccountInfo": {
      "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
      "accountNumber": "123450000",
      "routingNumber": "000123456",
      "accountCategory": "CHECKING",
      "bankName": "Example Bank"
    }
  }'
```

The API allows creating a user with minimal PII.

Here is an example of a user creation request body `bankAccountInfo` is always required:

```json
{
  "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
  "userType": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "bankAccountInfo": {
    "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
    "accountNumber": "123450000",
    "routingNumber": "000123456",
    "accountCategory": "CHECKING",
    "bankName": "Example Bank"
  }
}
```

The examples below show a more comprehensive set of data. Not all fields are strictly required by the API for user creation itself, but become necessary based on currency and UMA provider requirements.

Example request body for an individual user:

```json
{
  "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
  "userType": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "fullName": "John Sender",
  "birthDate": "1985-06-15",
  "address": {
    "line1": "Paseo de la Reforma 222",
    "line2": "Piso 15",
    "city": "Ciudad de México",
    "state": "Ciudad de México",
    "postalCode": "06600",
    "country": "MX"
  },
  "bankAccountInfo": {
    "accountType": "CLABE",
    "clabeNumber": "123456789012345678",
    "bankName": "Banco de México"
  }
}
```

Example request body for a business user:

```json
{
  "platformUserId": "b87d2e4a9c13f5b",
  "userType": "BUSINESS",
  "businessInfo": {
    "legalName": "Acme Corporation",
    "registrationNumber": "789012345",
    "taxId": "123-45-6789"
  },
  "address": {
    "line1": "456 Oak Avenue",
    "line2": "Floor 12",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10001",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "bankAccountInfo": {
    "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
    "accountNumber": "123456789",
    "routingNumber": "987654321",
    "accountCategory": "CHECKING",
    "bankName": "Chase Bank"
  }
}
```

## User Management

### Retrieving User Information

You can retrieve user information using either the Grid-assigned user ID or your platform's user ID:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/users/{userId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
```

or list users with a filter:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/users?platformUserId={platformUserId}&userType={userType}&createdAfter={createdAfter}&createdBefore={createdBefore}&cursor={cursor}&limit={limit}" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
```

Note that this example shows all available filters. You can use any combination of them.

### Updating User Information

To update user information:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/users/{userId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bankAccountInfo": {
      "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
      "accountNumber": "123456789",
      "routingNumber": "987654321",
      "bankName": "Chase Bank"
    }
  }'
```

Example request body for updating a user's bank account information:

```json
{
  "bankAccountInfo": {
    "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
    "accountNumber": "123456789",
    "routingNumber": "987654321",
    "bankName": "Chase Bank"
  }
}
```

## Bank Account Information

The API supports various bank account formats based on country and funding type. There are two types of funding
mechanisms supported by Grid: an omnibus FBO (for benefit of) account owned by the platform, or direct user-owned accounts. You must provide the correct format based on the user's region and bank account type.

### Optional Platform Account ID

All bank account types support an optional `platformAccountId` field that allows you to link bank accounts to your internal systems. This field can be any string that helps identify the account in your platform (e.g., database IDs, custom references, etc.).

Example with platform account ID:

```json
{
  "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
  "accountNumber": "123456789",
  "routingNumber": "987654321",
  "bankName": "Chase Bank",
  "platformAccountId": "chase_primary_1234"
}
```

Common use cases for `platformAccountId`:

- Tracking multiple bank accounts and uma addresses for the same user
- Linking accounts to internal accounting systems
- Maintaining consistency between the Grid API and your platform's account records
- Facilitating account reconciliation and reporting

### FBO Accounts

FBO accounts are used when the platform has a single omnibus account that is used to fund all users. Account details
must be provided manually at the platform level. For each user, during you should simply provide:

```json
"bankAccountInfo": {
  "accountType": "FBO",
  "currencyCode": "USD" // or any other currency code supported by the Grid API
}
```

:::tip
Please contact us to set up FBO account for a specific currency.

### Mexico: CLABE

```json
{
  "accountType": "CLABE",
  "clabeNumber": "123456789012345678",
  "bankName": "Banco de México",
  "platformAccountId": "banco_mx_primary_5678"
}
```

### United States: ACH (Account and Routing Number)

```json
{
  "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
  "accountNumber": "123456789",
  "routingNumber": "987654321",
  "accountCategory": "CHECKING",
  "bankName": "Chase Bank",
  "platformAccountId": "chase_checking_1234"
}
```

### Brazil: PIX

```json
{
  "accountType": "PIX",
  "pixKey": "12345678901",
  "pixKeyType": "CPF",
  "platformAccountId": "pix_main_9012"
}
```

PIX key types can be one of: `CPF`, `CNPJ`, `PHONE`, `EMAIL`, or `RANDOM`.

### India: UPI (Unified Payments Interface)

```json
{
  "accountType": "UPI",
  "vpa": "someuser@okbank",
  "platformAccountId": "upi_primary_1234"
}
```

### International: IBAN

```json
{
  "accountType": "IBAN",
  "iban": "DE89370400440532013000",
  "bankName": "Deutsche Bank",
  "platformAccountId": "deutsche_primary_3456"
}
```

## Data Validation

The Grid API performs validation on all user data. Common validation rules include:

- All required fields must be present based on user type
- Date of birth must be in YYYY-MM-DD format and represent a valid date
- Names must not contain special characters or excessive spaces
- Bank account information must follow country-specific formats
- Addresses must include all required fields including country code

If validation fails, the API will return a 400 Bad Request response with detailed error information.

## Best Practices

1. **Identity Verification**: Choose a proper KYC/KYB identity verification flow as detailed in the [Quickstart Guide](/payouts/quickstart#choosing-your-onboarding-flow)
2. **Data Security**: Store and transmit user data securely, following data protection regulations
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep user information up to date, especially banking details
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to manage validation failures gracefully
5. **Idempotent Operations**: Use your platformUserId consistently to avoid duplicate user creation

## Bulk User Import Operations

For scenarios where you need to add many users to the system at once, the API provides a CSV file upload endpoint.

### CSV File Upload

For large-scale user imports, you can upload a CSV file containing user information:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/users/bulk/csv" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -F "file=@users.csv"
```

The CSV file should follow a specific format with required and optional columns based on user type. Here's an example:

```csv
platformUserId,userType,fullName,birthDate,addressLine1,city,state,postalCode,country,accountType,accountNumber,bankName,platformAccountId,businessLegalName,routingNumber,accountCategory
user123,INDIVIDUAL,John Doe,1990-01-15,123 Main St,San Francisco,CA,94105,US,US_ACCOUNT,123456789,Chase Bank,chase_primary_1234,,222888888,SAVINGS
biz456,BUSINESS,,,400 Commerce Way,Austin,TX,78701,US,US_ACCOUNT,987654321,Bank of America,boa_business_5678,Acme Corp,121212121,CHECKING
```

:::tip CSV Upload Best Practices

1. Use a spreadsheet application to prepare your CSV file
2. Validate data before upload (e.g., date formats, required fields)
3. Include a header row with column names
4. Use UTF-8 encoding for special characters
5. Keep file size under 100MB for optimal processing
:::

You can track the job status through:

1. Webhook notifications (if configured)
2. Status polling endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/users/bulk/jobs/{jobId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
```

Example job status response:

```json
{
  "jobId": "job_123456789",
  "status": "PROCESSING",
  "progress": {
    "total": 5000,
    "processed": 2500,
    "successful": 2499,
    "failed": 1
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "platformUserId": "biz456",
      "error": {
        "code": "validation_error",
        "message": "Invalid bank account number"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

:::tip Best Practices for Bulk Operations

1. Use platform user IDs to track individual users in the bulk operation
2. Implement proper error handling for partial successes
3. Consider breaking very large datasets into multiple smaller jobs
4. Use webhooks for real-time status updates on asynchronous jobs
5. For CSV uploads, validate your data before submission
