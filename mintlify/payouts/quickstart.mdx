This comprehensive guide covers cross-border payouts from basic examples to advanced multi-currency scenarios. Learn how to enable payments across fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins for different customer types using the Grid API.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, ensure you have:

- A Grid API account with valid authentication credentials
- Access to the Grid API endpoints (production or sandbox)
- A webhook endpoint configured to receive notifications
- Understanding of your customer type and compliance requirements

## Overview

Cross-border payments enable transfers between different currencies using real-time exchange rates. The Grid API supports:

- **Fiat currencies**: USD (primary), with support for other currencies as external accounts
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other major cryptocurrencies  
- **Stablecoins**: USDC, USDT, and other USD-pegged stablecoins

### Funding Account Types

- **Internal Accounts**: USD-only accounts managed by Grid, funded via ACH pull
- **External Accounts**: Multi-currency accounts supporting various asset types including fiat, crypto, and stablecoins

## Basic Example: Send to Foreign Bank Account

This example walks through the complete process of sending funds to an external bank account, from customer onboarding through quote execution.

### Step 1: Customer Onboarding

<KycOnboarding />

### Step 2: List Internal Accounts

Once the customer is created, list their internal accounts to see the available balances and funding instructions.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/internal-account?customerId=Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
      "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
      "balance": {
        "amount": 0,
        "currency": {
          "code": "USD",
          "name": "United States Dollar",
          "symbol": "$",
          "decimals": 2
        }
      },
      "fundingPaymentInstructions": [
        {
          "reference": "FUND-ABC123",
          "instructionsNotes": "Include the reference code in your ACH transfer memo",
          "bankAccountInfo": {
            "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
            "accountNumber": "9876543210",
            "routingNumber": "021000021",
            "accountHolderName": "Lightspark Grid FBO John Doe",
            "bankName": "JP Morgan Chase"
          }
        }
      ],
      "createdAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "hasMore": false,
  "totalCount": 1
}
```

The `fundingPaymentInstructions` provide the bank account details and reference code needed to fund this internal account via ACH pull from the customer's bank.

### Step 3: Fund the Internal Account

Your customer initiates an ACH transfer from their bank to the account details provided in the funding instructions, making sure to include the reference code `FUND-ABC123` in the transfer memo.

<Note>
  In sandbox mode, you can use the `/sandbox/receive` endpoint to simulate receiving funds. In production, actual ACH transfers typically take 1-3 business days to settle.
</Note>

**Webhook Notification:**
```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "id": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000010",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "INCOMING",
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 100000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "settledAt": "2025-10-03T14:30:00Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-03T14:25:00Z",
    "description": "Internal account funding"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020",
  "type": "INCOMING_PAYMENT"
}
```

The internal account now has a balance of $1,000.00 (100000 cents).

### Step 4: Add an External Bank Account

Now add the destination bank account where you want to send the funds. In this example, we'll add a Mexican CLABE account.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/customers/external-accounts" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "currency": "MXN",
    "platformAccountId": "maria_garcia_account",
    "accountInfo": {
      "accountType": "CLABE",
      "clabeNumber": "123456789012345678",
      "bankName": "BBVA Mexico",
      "beneficiary": {
        "beneficiaryType": "INDIVIDUAL",
        "fullName": "Maria Garcia",
        "birthDate": "1990-01-01",
        "nationality": "MX",
        "address": {
          "line1": "Av. Reforma 123",
          "city": "Ciudad de México",
          "state": "CDMX",
          "postalCode": "06600",
          "country": "MX"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
  "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "currency": "MXN",
  "platformAccountId": "maria_garcia_account",
  "accountInfo": {
    "accountType": "CLABE",
    "clabeNumber": "123456789012345678",
    "bankName": "BBVA Mexico",
    "beneficiary": {
      "beneficiaryType": "INDIVIDUAL",
      "fullName": "Maria Garcia",
      "birthDate": "1990-01-01",
      "nationality": "MX",
      "address": {
        "line1": "Av. Reforma 123",
        "city": "Ciudad de México",
        "state": "CDMX",
        "postalCode": "06600",
        "country": "MX"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Look Up the External Account

Before creating a quote, look up the external account to verify supported currencies and get estimated exchange rates.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/receiver/external-account/ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123?customerId=Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
  "supportedCurrencies": [
    {
      "currency": {
        "code": "MXN",
        "name": "Mexican Peso",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      },
      "estimatedExchangeRate": 17.25,
      "min": 1000,
      "max": 1000000
    }
  ],
  "lookupId": "LookupRequest:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000009"
}
```

This shows you can send MXN to this account, with an estimated exchange rate of 17.25 MXN per 1 USD. The minimum send amount is 10.00 MXN and maximum is 10,000.00 MXN.

### Step 6: Create a Quote

Create a quote to lock in the exchange rate, fees, and get the final transfer details.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/quotes" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lookupId": "LookupRequest:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000009",
    "source": {
      "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965"
    },
    "destination": {
      "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
      "currency": "MXN"
    },
    "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
    "lockedCurrencyAmount": 50000,
    "description": "Payment to Maria Garcia for services"
  }'
```

<Note>
  **Amount Locking**: You can lock either the sending amount (`SENDING`) or receiving amount (`RECEIVING`). In this example, we're locking the sending amount to exactly $500.00 USD (50000 cents).
</Note>

**Response:**
```json
{
  "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-03T15:05:00Z",
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
    "currency": "MXN"
  },
  "sendingCurrency": {
    "code": "USD",
    "name": "United States Dollar",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "receivingCurrency": {
    "code": "MXN",
    "name": "Mexican Peso",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "totalSendingAmount": 50000,
  "totalReceivingAmount": 861250,
  "exchangeRate": 17.25,
  "feesIncluded": 250,
  "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000015"
}
```

The quote shows:
- **Sending**: $500.00 USD (including $2.50 fee)
- **Receiving**: $8,612.50 MXN
- **Exchange rate**: 17.25 MXN per USD
- **Quote expires**: In 5 minutes

<Warning>
  Quotes typically expire in 1-5 minutes. Make sure to execute the quote before the `expiresAt` timestamp, or you'll need to create a new quote.
</Warning>

**Alternative: Send Payout To External Account For Crypto**

Send a BTC payout from an internal account to an external account executed immediately:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/quotes" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": {
      "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965"
    },
    "destination": {
      "externalAccountDetails": {
        "beneficiary": {
          "counterPartyType": "INDIVIDUAL",
          "fullName": "Maria Garcia",
          "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
          "nationality": "MX"
        },
        "accountInfo": {
          "accountType": "SPARK_WALLET",
          "address": "sprt1pgssyuuuhnrrdjswal5c3s3rafw9w3y5dd4cjy3duxlf7hjzkp0rqx6dj6mrhu"
        }
      }
    },
    "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
    "lockedCurrencyAmount": 50000,
    "immediatelyExecute": true,
    "description": "Payment to Maria Garcia for services"
  }'
```

### Step 7: Execute the Quote

Execute the quote to initiate the transfer from the internal account to the external bank account.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/quotes/Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006/execute" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006",
  "status": "PROCESSING",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-03T15:05:00Z",
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
    "currency": "MXN"
  },
  "sendingCurrency": {
    "code": "USD",
    "name": "United States Dollar",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "receivingCurrency": {
    "code": "MXN",
    "name": "Mexican Peso",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "totalSendingAmount": 50000,
  "totalReceivingAmount": 861250,
  "exchangeRate": 17.25,
  "feesIncluded": 250,
  "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000015"
}
```

The quote status changes to `PROCESSING` and the transfer is initiated. You can track the status by:
1. Polling the quote endpoint: `GET /quotes/{quoteId}`
2. Waiting for a webhook notification

**Completion Webhook:**
```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "id": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000015",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "OUTGOING",
    "sentAmount": {
      "amount": 50000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 861250,
      "currency": {
        "code": "MXN",
        "name": "Mexican Peso",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "settledAt": "2025-10-03T15:02:30Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
    "description": "Payment to Maria Garcia for services",
    "exchangeRate": 17.25,
    "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T15:03:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025",
  "type": "OUTGOING_PAYMENT"
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Currency Selection
- **USD (Internal Accounts)**: Primary fiat currency for traditional business payments
- **Multi-currency (External Accounts)**: Support for various fiat, crypto, and stablecoin currencies
- **Stablecoins**: Ideal for faster settlements and lower fees
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Suitable for tech-savvy businesses and international transfers

### 2. Exchange Rate Management
- Always check current rates before creating quotes
- Consider quote expiration times (typically 1-5 minutes)
- Use internal accounts for USD funding or external accounts for multi-currency funding

### 3. Compliance Considerations
- Ensure proper KYB/KYC verification for each customer type
- Maintain audit trails for all cross-border transactions
- Implement proper webhook signature verification
- Support both business-to-business and business-to-individual payment flows

### 4. Error Handling
- Monitor quote status and handle failures gracefully
- Implement proper retry mechanisms for failed transfers
- Use webhooks for real-time status updates
- Handle both internal and external account funding scenarios
