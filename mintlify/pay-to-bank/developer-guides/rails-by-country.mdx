### Tips
- Use `/receiver/external-account/{accountId}` to confirm supported currencies and limits for a specific destination.
- For same-currency transfers, consider `/transfer-in` and `/transfer-out` endpoints.
- For crypto and stablecoin destinations, ensure destination wallets are correctly configured and test via sandbox before going live.
