import KycOnboarding from "/snippets/kyc-onboarding.mdx";

This guide walks you through the complete process of converting USD to Bitcoin and sending it to a Spark wallet using just-in-time (JIT) funding.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, ensure you have:

- A Grid API account with valid authentication credentials
- Access to the Grid API endpoints (production or sandbox)
- A webhook endpoint configured to receive notifications
- A Spark wallet address where the Bitcoin will be delivered

## Overview

The on-ramp process consists of the following steps:

1. **Create a customer** via the API
2. **Create a quote** for the USD-to-BTC conversion with current exchange rate
3. **Fund the quote** using the provided payment instructions (JIT funding)
4. **Receive webhook notification** confirming Bitcoin delivery to the Spark wallet

---

## Step 1: Customer Onboarding

Onboard customers via the API. The required information depends on your platform's regulatory status.

## Step 2: Create a Quote for Fiat-to-Crypto Conversion

Create a quote to convert USD to Bitcoin and deliver it to a Spark wallet. The quote will provide the current exchange rate and payment instructions for funding.

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/quotes" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": {
      "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "destination": {
      "externalAccountDetails": {
        "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
        "currency": "BTC",
        "accountInfo": {
          "accountType": "SPARK_WALLET",
          "address": "sprt1pgssyuuuhnrrdjswal5c3s3rafw9w3y5dd4cjy3duxlf7hjzkp0rqx6dj6mrhu"
        }
      }
    },
    "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
    "lockedCurrencyAmount": 10000,
    "description": "On-ramp: Buy $100 of Bitcoin"
  }'
```

<Note>
  **Combined External Account Creation**: The `externalAccountDetails` option
  automatically creates the external account (Spark wallet) and uses it as the
  destination for the Bitcoin transfer in a single API call.
</Note>

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",

  "source": {
    "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:b23dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d456",
    "currency": "BTC"
  },
  "sendingCurrency": {
    "code": "USD",
    "name": "United States Dollar",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "receivingCurrency": {
    "code": "BTC",
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "symbol": "₿",
    "decimals": 8
  },
  "totalSendingAmount": 10000,
  "totalReceivingAmount": 95000,
  "exchangeRate": 9.5,
  "feesIncluded": 250,
  "paymentInstructions": [
    {
      "reference": "RAMP-ABC123",
      "instructionsNotes": "Include reference code in transfer memo",
      "bankAccountInfo": {
        "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
        "accountNumber": "9876543210",
        "routingNumber": "021000021",
        "accountHolderName": "Lightspark Grid FBO Customer",
        "bankName": "JP Morgan Chase"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The quote shows:

- **Sending**: $100.00 USD (including $2.50 fee)
- **Receiving**: 0.00095 BTC (95,000 satoshis)
- **Exchange rate**: 9.5 sats per USD cent (~$105,000 per BTC)
- **Quote expires**: In 5 minutes
- **Payment instructions**: Bank account details and reference code for funding

<Warning>
  For JIT-funded quotes, do NOT call the `/quotes/{quoteId}/execute` endpoint.
  Simply fund using the payment instructions, and Grid will automatically
  execute the conversion upon receiving your payment.
</Warning>

---

## Step 3: Fund the Quote (Just-in-Time)

In production, you would initiate a real-time push payment (ACH, RTP, wire, etc.) to the bank account provided in `paymentInstructions`, making sure to include the exact reference code `RAMP-ABC123` in the transfer memo.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Sandbox (Simulated)">
In Sandbox, you can simulate funding using the `/sandbox/send` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/sandbox/send" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reference": "RAMP-ABC123",
    "currencyCode": "USD",
    "currencyAmount": 10000
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025",
  "status": "PROCESSING",
  "type": "OUTGOING",
  "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006"
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Production (Real Funding)">
In production, your customer or platform would initiate a bank transfer to the provided account details, include the reference code `RAMP-ABC123` in the transfer memo, and wait for Grid to detect the incoming payment (typically 1-3 business days for ACH, instant for RTP/wire). You'll receive a webhook notification when Bitcoin is delivered to the Spark wallet.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  The reference code is critical for matching your payment to the quote. Always
  include it exactly as provided in the payment instructions.
</Tip>

---

## Step 4: Receive Completion Webhook

Once Grid receives your payment and completes the USD-to-BTC conversion and delivery, you'll receive a webhook notification:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "id": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "OUTGOING",
    "sentAmount": {
      "amount": 10000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 95000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "BTC",
        "name": "Bitcoin",
        "symbol": "₿",
        "decimals": 8
      }
    },
    "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "settledAt": "2025-10-03T15:02:30Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
    "description": "On-ramp: Buy $100 of Bitcoin",
    "exchangeRate": 9.5,
    "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006",
    "paymentInstructions": {
      "reference": "RAMP-ABC123"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T15:03:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000030",
  "type": "OUTGOING_PAYMENT"
}
```

<Check>
  The customer now has 95,000 satoshis (0.00095 BTC) in their Spark wallet!
</Check>
