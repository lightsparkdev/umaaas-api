title: "Implementation Overview"
---

This page gives you a 10,000‑ft view of an end‑to‑end ramps implementation. It is intentionally generalized to cover both on-ramp (fiat → crypto) and off-ramp (crypto → fiat) flows. The detailed guides that follow provide concrete fields, edge cases, and step‑by‑step instructions.

<Info>
  This overview highlights the main building blocks: platform setup, customer
  onboarding, account management, conversion flows, reconciliation, sandbox
  testing, and go‑live enablement.
</Info>

## Platform configuration

Configure your platform once before building user flows.

- Provide webhook endpoints for transaction and conversion status notifications
- Generate API credentials for Sandbox (and later Production)
- Configure supported currencies for conversions (fiat and crypto)
- Review settlement methods and supported crypto destinations

## Onboarding customers

Onboard customers who will use ramp services. There are two patterns:

- Regulated platforms can directly create customers by providing minimal KYC data via API
- Unregulated entities should request a KYC link and embed the hosted KYC flow; once completed, the customer can transact

You'll need to persist the Grid customer IDs for use in conversion flows.

## Account management

Set up accounts for funding and receiving conversions.

### Internal Accounts

- Platform and customer internal accounts hold fiat or crypto balances
- Used for pre-funded off-ramp scenarios (crypto → fiat)
- Fund via ACH, wire, or crypto deposits

### External Accounts

- Register crypto wallets (Spark, Bitcoin addresses) for on-ramp destinations
- Register bank accounts for off-ramp destinations
- Capture required beneficiary and account information

<Tip>
  On-ramps typically deliver to external crypto wallets, while off-ramps
  typically deliver to external bank accounts.
</Tip>

## On-ramp flow (Fiat → Crypto)

Enable users to convert fiat currency to cryptocurrency.

### Quote Creation

- Create a quote specifying source (fiat) and destination (crypto wallet)
- Lock exchange rate and receive payment instructions
- Quote includes reference code for payment matching

### Just-in-Time Funding

- User sends fiat payment to provided bank account details
- Include reference code in payment memo for matching
- Grid detects payment and automatically executes conversion

### Crypto Delivery

- Grid converts fiat to crypto at locked rate
- Crypto delivered to specified wallet (Spark, Bitcoin, etc.)
- Webhook notification confirms delivery

<Note>
  For JIT-funded quotes, do NOT call the execute endpoint. Grid automatically
  processes the conversion when it receives your payment.
</Note>

## Off-ramp flow (Crypto → Fiat)

Enable users to convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency.

### Pre-funding

- Customer or platform holds crypto in internal accounts
- Balances can be funded via crypto deposits (Lightning, on-chain)

### Quote and Execution

- Create a quote specifying source (crypto account) and destination (bank account)
- Lock exchange rate and fees
- Execute the quote to initiate conversion
- Grid converts crypto to fiat and delivers to bank account

### Fiat Delivery

- Fiat delivered via local banking rails
- Settlement times vary by destination (instant to 1-3 business days)
- Webhook notification confirms delivery

## Self-custody wallet integration

Support for sending crypto to user-controlled wallets.

- **Spark wallets**: Lightning-compatible wallets for instant, low-fee Bitcoin transfers
- **Validation**: Validate wallet addresses before creating external accounts
- **Limits**: Verify minimum and maximum amounts for crypto transfers
- **Monitoring**: Track transfer completion via webhooks

<Tip>
  Spark wallets are recommended for crypto delivery as transfers complete within
  seconds with minimal fees.
</Tip>

## Reconciling transactions

Implement operational processes to keep your ledger in sync.

- Process webhooks idempotently; map statuses (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Tie transactions back to quotes and customers
- Track conversion rates and fees for accurate accounting
- Query for transactions by date range or customer as necessary

## Testing in Sandbox

Use Sandbox to build and validate end‑to‑end without moving real funds.

- Simulate fiat funding using `/sandbox/send` endpoint
- Simulate crypto deposits using `/sandbox/receive` endpoint
- Test quote creation, conversion, and webhook lifecycles
- Validate customer onboarding flows with test data

## Enabling Production

When you're ready to go live:

- Ensure adequate funding mechanisms are in place (for off-ramps)
- Confirm webhook security, monitoring, and alerting are configured
- Review rate limits, error handling, and idempotency
- Test conversion flows thoroughly in Sandbox
- Run final UAT in Sandbox, then request Production access from our team
