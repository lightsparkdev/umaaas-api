GRID Ramps provide the foundational infrastructure to connect the traditional financial system with the world of digital assets. Our API-driven solution allows partners to seamlessly embed on-ramp (fiat-to-crypto) and off-ramp (crypto-to-fiat) functionality directly into their applications.

How an On-Ramp Works
<Info>
The on-ramp process is designed to be simple and secure, moving from quote to settlement with automated confirmations at each stage.
</Info>
<Steps>
  <Step title="Request a Quote">
    The user decides to buy a digital asset. Your application calls our `/ramps/quote` endpoint specifying the currency, amount, and destination.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock Rate & Display Instructions">
    The user accepts the quote. Your application locks it and displays the specific payment instructions (e.g., bank account and a reference code) returned by the GRID API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Fiat Payment">
    The user sends their fiat funds. GRID automatically detects the payment and sends a webhook to your system confirming receipt.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deliver Digital Assets">
    Upon confirmation, GRID executes the transaction, delivering the digital assets to the user's destination wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>
