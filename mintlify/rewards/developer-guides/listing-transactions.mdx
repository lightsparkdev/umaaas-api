Retrieve transaction history for Bitcoin rewards distributed through your platform. Transactions are returned in descending order (most recent first) and are paginated.

```bash cURL

```

## Common filtering patterns

### Rewards for a specific customer

Get all Bitcoin rewards sent to a customer:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?customerId=Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

Or use your platform's customer ID:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?platformCustomerId=user_789' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

### Rewards by date range

Get all rewards distributed in a specific period:

```bash
# October 2025 rewards
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?startDate=2025-10-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2025-10-31T23:59:59Z' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

<Tip>Dates must be in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2025-10-03T15:00:00Z`).</Tip>

### Failed rewards

Track rewards that failed to complete:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?status=FAILED&type=OUTGOING' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

**Transaction statuses:**

- `PENDING` - Reward initiated, awaiting processing
- `PROCESSING` - Bitcoin purchase and transfer in progress
- `COMPLETED` - Reward successfully delivered
- `FAILED` - Reward failed (invalid wallet address, insufficient balance, etc.)

### Rewards from platform account

Get all rewards paid from your platform's USD internal account:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?senderAccountIdentifier=InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965&type=OUTGOING' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

## Combining filters

Narrow down results by combining multiple filters:

```bash
# All completed rewards for a customer in October
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?platformCustomerId=user_789&status=COMPLETED&startDate=2025-10-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2025-10-31T23:59:59Z' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

## Pagination

Handle large result sets with cursor-based pagination. Use the `nextCursor` value from each response in subsequent requests:

```bash
# First page
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?platformCustomerId=user_789&limit=100' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'

# Next page (use the nextCursor from the previous response)
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?platformCustomerId=user_789&limit=100&cursor=eyJpZCI6IlRyYW5z...' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

Continue fetching pages until `hasMore` is `false` in the response.

<Info>The maximum `limit` is 100 transactions per request. Default is 20.</Info>

## Get a single transaction

Retrieve details for a specific reward transaction:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions/Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

## Common use cases

### Calculate total rewards distributed

To calculate monthly totals, retrieve all completed transactions for the period and sum the amounts:

```bash
# Get all completed rewards for October 2025
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?status=COMPLETED&startDate=2025-10-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2025-10-31T23:59:59Z&limit=100' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

Sum the `sentAmount.amount` (USD sent) and `receivedAmount.amount` (BTC received) fields from each transaction. Remember to convert amounts using the `decimals` field in the currency object (USD: 2 decimals, BTC: 8 decimals).

### Track customer reward history

Get a customer's complete reward history:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?platformCustomerId=user_789&status=COMPLETED' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

The response includes:
- `totalCount`: Total number of completed rewards
- `data`: Array of transactions with amounts and timestamps
- Sum the `receivedAmount.amount` values for total satoshis received

### Monitor failed rewards

Track failed reward transactions to identify issues:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/transactions?status=FAILED&type=OUTGOING&startDate=2025-10-01T00:00:00Z' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

Review the returned transactions to identify:
- Transaction IDs
- Customer IDs (`platformCustomerId`)
- Failed amounts
- Failure timestamps (`createdAt`)
- Descriptions or error messages

## Best practices

<Check>
Use pagination when fetching transaction history to avoid timeouts and memory issues.
</Check>

<Check>
Filter by `platformCustomerId` for easier reconciliation with your internal user IDs.
</Check>

<Check>
Cache completed transaction data since it won't change after settlement.
</Check>

<Warning>
Always filter by `type=OUTGOING` when tracking rewards to exclude incoming transactions.
</Warning>
