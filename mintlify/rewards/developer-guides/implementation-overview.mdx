title: "Implementation Overview"
---

This page gives you a 10,000‑ft view of an end‑to‑end Bitcoin rewards implementation. It is intentionally generalized to cover the main building blocks. The detailed guides that follow provide concrete fields, edge cases, and step‑by‑step instructions.

<Info>
This overview highlights the main building blocks: platform setup, funding, customer onboarding, external account creation, and Bitcoin reward distribution.
</Info>

## Platform configuration

Configure your platform once before building user flows.

- Provide webhook endpoints for transaction and account status notifications
- Generate API credentials for Sandbox (and later Production)
- Configure supported currencies (typically a Fiat currency and BTC or stables for rewards)

## Platform account funding

Fund your platform's internal account to enable instant Bitcoin rewards distribution.

- **Platform internal accounts**: Automatically created for each supported currency when your platform is set up
- **Funding options**: ACH transfer, wire transfer, or crypto deposits (BTC, Stablecoins)
- **Balance management**: Monitor balances via API or webhook notifications to ensure sufficient funds for rewards distribution

<Tip>
For Bitcoin rewards, maintaining a prefunded USD balance allows you to instantly purchase and distribute Bitcoin to customers without delays.
</Tip>

## Onboarding customers

Onboard customers who will receive Bitcoin rewards. There are two patterns:

- Regulated platforms can directly create customers by providing minimal KYC data via API
- Unregulated entities should request a KYC link and embed the hosted KYC flow; once completed, the customer can receive rewards

You'll need to persist the Grid customer IDs for use in reward distribution flows.

## External account creation

Register external accounts where customers will receive their Bitcoin rewards.

- **Spark wallets**: Lightning-compatible Spark wallets for instant, low-fee transfers of Bitcoin and Stablecoins
- **Other cryptocurrency wallets**: Support for various Bitcoin destination types
- Capture wallet addresses and validate formats where applicable

<Note>
Spark wallets are recommended for Bitcoin rewards as transfers complete within seconds with minimal fees.
</Note>

## Distributing rewards

Send Bitcoin rewards to customers using a streamlined quote-and-execute flow.

- **Create and execute quote**: Specify source (your platform's USD account), destination (customer's Spark wallet), and amount
- **Currency conversion**: Platform handles USD to BTC conversion at current market rates
- **Immediate execution**: Use `immediatelyExecute: true` for one-step market-order style distribution
- **Monitor status**: Track completion via webhooks or polling

<Tip>
For recurring small-dollar rewards, use `immediatelyExecute: true` to skip the quote confirmation step and send at the current market rate.
</Tip>

## Reconciling transactions

Implement operational processes to keep your ledger in sync.

- Process webhooks idempotently; map statuses (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Tie transactions back to customers and reward events
- Monitor platform account balances to ensure adequate funding
- Query for transactions by date range or customer as necessary

## Testing in Sandbox

Use Sandbox to build and validate end‑to‑end without moving real funds.

- Simulate account funding using `/sandbox/receive` endpoint
- Test quote creation, execution, and webhook lifecycles
- Validate customer onboarding flows with test data

## Enabling Production

When you're ready to go live:

- Ensure adequate funding in your production platform account
- Confirm webhook security, monitoring, and alerting are in place
- Review rate limits, error handling, and idempotency
- Run final UAT in Sandbox, then request Production access from our team
