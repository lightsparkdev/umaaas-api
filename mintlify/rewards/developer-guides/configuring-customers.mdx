This guide covers everything you need to know about creating and managing customers in the Grid API for Bitcoin rewards distribution.

## Overview

Customers are the recipients of your Bitcoin rewards. They can be individuals or businesses. Each customer in the Grid system has:

- **System-generated ID**: Unique identifier assigned by Grid (e.g., `Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001`)
- **Customer Type**: Either `INDIVIDUAL` or `BUSINESS`
- **KYC Status**: Indicates if the customer has been verified and approved.
- **Internal Accounts**: Automatically created for each supported currency upon customer creation
- **Platform Customer ID**: Optional field to link to your own user/customer ID

<Note>
The `platformCustomerId` field is optional but recommended. Use your existing user IDs to maintain a simple mapping between your system and Grid.
</Note>

### Creating Customers via API

For platforms that are regulated financial institutions who already handle your own KYC/KYB, you can create customers directly via API with lower data requirements.

#### Create Individual Customer

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/customers" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "platformCustomerId": "user_12345",
    "customerType": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "fullName": "Jane Doe",
    "birthDate": "1992-03-25",
    "nationality": "US"
  }'
```

#### Create Business Customer

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/customers" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "platformCustomerId": "biz_67890",
    "customerType": "BUSINESS",
    "businessInfo": {
      "legalName": "Acme Corporation",
      "registrationNumber": "BRN-456789123",
      "taxId": "EIN-987123456"
    },
    "address": {
      "line1": "400 Commerce Way",
      "city": "Austin",
      "state": "TX",
      "postalCode": "78701",
      "country": "US"
    }
  }'
```

### Response

Both requests return a customer object:

```json
{
  "id": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "platformCustomerId": "user_12345",
  "customerType": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "kycStatus": "APPROVED",
  "umaAddress": "$jane.doe@uma.domain.com",
  "fullName": "Jane Doe",
  "birthDate": "1992-03-25",

  "updatedAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z",
  "isDeleted": false

```

<Info>
When a customer is created successfully, internal accounts are automatically created for each currency configured on your platform. These accounts can be used as sources or destinations for transfers.

<Tip>
To find a specific customer by your platform ID, use: `GET /customers?platformCustomerId=user_12345`
</Tip>

## Retrieving a Single Customer

Get detailed information about a specific customer:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/customers/{customerId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
```

## Deleting Customers

Delete a customer by their system-generated ID:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.lightspark.com/grid/2025-10-13/customers/{customerId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
```

<Warning>
Deleting a customer is permanent and will prevent them from receiving future payments. Their transaction history will be preserved but the customer record will be marked as deleted.
</Warning>
