This guide covers everything you need to know about creating and managing customers in the Grid API for Bitcoin rewards distribution.

## Overview

Customers are the recipients of your Bitcoin rewards. They can be individuals or businesses. Each customer in the Grid system has:

- **System-generated ID**: Unique identifier assigned by Grid (e.g., `Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001`)
- **Customer Type**: Either `INDIVIDUAL` or `BUSINESS`
- **KYC Status**: Indicates if the customer has been verified and approved.
- **Internal Accounts**: Automatically created for each supported currency upon customer creation
- **Platform Customer ID**: Optional field to link to your own user/customer ID

<Note>
The `platformCustomerId` field is optional but recommended. Use your existing user IDs to maintain a simple mapping between your system and Grid.
</Note>

### Creating Customers via API

For platforms that are regulated financial institutions who already handle your own KYC/KYB, you can create customers directly via API with lower data requirements.

#### Create Individual Customer

```http
POST /customers
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "platformCustomerId": "user_12345",
  "customerType": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "fullName": "Jane Doe",
  "birthDate": "1992-03-25",
  "nationality": "US"
}
```

#### Create Business Customer

```http
POST /customers
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "platformCustomerId": "biz_67890",
  "customerType": "BUSINESS",
  "businessInfo": {
    "legalName": "Acme Corporation",
    "registrationNumber": "BRN-456789123",
    "taxId": "EIN-987123456"
  },
  "address": {
    "line1": "400 Commerce Way",
    "city": "Austin",
    "state": "TX",
    "postalCode": "78701",
    "country": "US"
  },
}
```

### Response

Both requests return a customer object:

```json
{
  "id": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "platformCustomerId": "user_12345",
  "customerType": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "kycStatus": "APPROVED",
  "umaAddress": "$jane.doe@uma.domain.com",
  "fullName": "Jane Doe",
  "birthDate": "1992-03-25",
  "nationality": "US",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z",
  "isDeleted": false
}
```

<Info>
When a customer is created successfully, internal accounts are automatically created for each currency configured on your platform. These accounts can be used as sources or destinations for transfers.
</Info>

## Listing Customers

Retrieve a paginated list of customers with optional filtering:

```http
GET /customers?limit=20&customerType=INDIVIDUAL
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

<Tip>
To find a specific customer by your platform ID, use: `GET /customers?platformCustomerId=user_12345`
</Tip>

## Retrieving a Single Customer

Get detailed information about a specific customer:

```http
GET /customers/{customerId}
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

## Deleting Customers

Delete a customer by their system-generated ID:

```http
DELETE /customers/{customerId}
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

<Warning>
Deleting a customer is permanent and will prevent them from receiving future payments. Their transaction history will be preserved but the customer record will be marked as deleted.
</Warning>
