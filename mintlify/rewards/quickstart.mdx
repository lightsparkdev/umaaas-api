This guide walks you through the complete process of buying Bitcoin with USD and sending it to a self-custody Spark wallet, from customer onboarding through quote execution.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, ensure you have:

- A Grid API account with valid authentication credentials
- Access to the Grid API endpoints (production or sandbox)
- A webhook endpoint configured to receive notifications
- A Spark wallet address where the Bitcoin will be sent

## Overview

The process consists of the following steps:

1. **List platform internal accounts** to find your platform's USD funding instructions
2. **Fund your internal account** via ACH push and receive a webhook notification
3. **Create a customer** using the hosted KYC/KYB link flow
4. **Execute a quote** to complete the Bitcoin purchase and transfer a reward to the user's own Spark wallet.

## Step 1: List your platform's internal accounts

When your platform is first created, it is automatically assigned an internal account with a balance in your configured fiat currency.
List your platform's internal accounts to see the available balances and funding instructions for USD.

### Request

```http
GET /platform/internal-accounts?currency=USD
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

### Response

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "id": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
      "balance": {
        "amount": 0,
        "currency": {
          "code": "USD",
          "name": "United States Dollar",
          "symbol": "$",
          "decimals": 2
        }
      },
      "fundingPaymentInstructions": [
        {
          "reference": "FUND-BTC123",
          "instructionsNotes": "Include the reference code in your ACH transfer memo",
          "bankAccountInfo": {
            "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
            "accountNumber": "9876543210",
            "routingNumber": "021000021",
            "accountHolderName": "Lightspark Grid FBO John Doe",
            "bankName": "JP Morgan Chase"
          }
        },
        {
          "accountType": "SPARK_WALLET",
          "asset": "USDB",
          "address": "sprt1pgssyuuuhnrrdjswal5c3s3rafw9w3y5dd4cjy3duxlf7hjzkp0rqx6dj6mrhu",
          "invoice": "lnbc15u1p3xnhl2pp5jptserfk3zk4qy42tlucycrfwxhydvlemu9pqr93tuzlv9cc7g3sdqsvfhkcap3xyhx7un8cqzpgxqzjcsp5f8c52y2stc300gl6s4xswtjpc37hrnnr3c9wvtgjfuvqmpm35evq9qyyssqy4lgd8tj637qcjp05rdpxxykjenthxftej7a2zzmwrmrl70fyj9hvj0rewhzj7jfyuwkwcg9g2jpwtk3wkjtwnkdks84hsnu8xps5vsq4gj5hs"
        }
      ],
      "createdAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
}
```

The `fundingPaymentInstructions` provide the bank account details and reference code needed to fund this internal account via ACH pull from the customer's bank.

<Note>
  You can also see that there are Spark wallet funding instructions in this example response which can be used to fund the internal account with USDB instantly.
</Note>

## Step 2: Fund your Internal Account

You can initiate an ACH transfer from your bank to the account details provided in the funding instructions, making sure to include the reference code `FUND-BTC123` in the transfer memo.

<Note>
  In sandbox mode, you can use the `/sandbox/receive` endpoint to simulate receiving funds. In production, actual ACH transfers typically take 1-3 business days to settle.
</Note>

### Webhook Notification

When the funds are received and the internal account balance is updated, you'll receive a webhook notification:

```json
{
  "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
  "oldBalance": {
    "amount": 0,
    "currency": {
      "code": "USD",
      "name": "United States Dollar",
      "symbol": "$",
      "decimals": 2
    }
  },
  "newBalance": {
    "amount": 200000,
    "currency": {
      "code": "USD",
      "name": "United States Dollar",
      "symbol": "$",
      "decimals": 2
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020",
  "type": "ACCOUNT_STATUS"
}
```

The internal account now has a balance of $2,000.00 (200000 cents). You can use this balance to instantly distribute Bitcoin rewards to your customers.

## Step 3: Customer Onboarding

<KycOnboarding />

## Step 4: Create and Execute a Quote to the Customer's Spark Wallet

Create and execute a trade from USD to BTC, and initiate the final transfer in one step. This combines external account
creation and quote execution using the `externalAccountDetails` option.

### Request

```http
POST /quotes
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965"
  },
  "destination": {
    "externalAccountDetails": {
      "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
      "currency": "BTC",
      "accountInfo": {
        "accountType": "SPARK_WALLET",
        "address": "spark1pgssyuuuhnrrdjswal5c3s3rafw9w3y5dd4cjy3duxlf7hjzkp0rqx6dj6mrhu"
      }
    }
  },
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 100,
  "immediatelyExecute": true, // Execute the quote immediately. See note below.
  "description": "Bitcoin reward payout!"
}
```

<Note>
  **Combined External Account Creation and Quote Execution**: The `externalAccountDetails` option allows you to
  create the external account and execute the quote in a single API call, which is perfect for one-off payments
  to new destinations. The external account will be automatically created and then used as the destination for
  the Bitcoin transfer. Its ID in the response can be used directly in future quote creation requests.

  **Immediate Quote Execution (Market Order)**: Note that `immediatelyExecute` is set to `true` in this example.
  Because we always just want to send $1.00 worth of BTC to users as a reward at the current market rate, we don't
  need to lock a quote and view the rate details before executing. If you want to lock a quote and confirm fees
  and exchange rate details before executing the quote, set `immediatelyExecute` to `false` or omit the field.
</Note>

### Response

```json
{
  "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020",
  "status": "PROCESSING",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-03T15:05:00Z",
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:b23dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d456",
    "currency": "BTC"
  },
  "sendingCurrency": {
    "code": "USD",
    "name": "United States Dollar",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "receivingCurrency": {
    "code": "BTC",
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "symbol": "₿",
    "decimals": 8
  },
  "totalSendingAmount": 100,
  "totalReceivingAmount": 810,
  "exchangeRate": 8.1,
  "feesIncluded": 5,
  "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025"
}
```

The quote shows:
- **Sending**: \$1.00 USD (including $0.05 fee)
- **Receiving**: 0.0000081 BTC (810 satoshis)
- **Exchange rate**: 8.1 sats per USD cent (~$123,000 per BTC)
- **External account created**: The Spark wallet was automatically added as an external account during quote creation

The quote status changes to `PROCESSING` and the Bitcoin transfer is initiated. The external account is created, USD is debited from the internal account, Bitcoin is purchased, and then sent to the Spark wallet address.

You can track the status by:
1. Polling the quote endpoint: `GET /quotes/{quoteId}`
2. Waiting for a webhook notification

### Completion Webhook

When the Bitcoin transfer completes, you'll receive a webhook notification:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "id": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "OUTGOING",
    "sentAmount": {
      "amount": 100,
      "currency": {

        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 810,
      "currency": {
        "code": "BTC",
        "name": "Bitcoin",
        "symbol": "₿",
        "decimals": 8
      }
    },
    "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "settledAt": "2025-10-03T15:01:45Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
    "description": "Bitcoin purchase for self-custody",
    "exchangeRate": 8.1,
    "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T15:02:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000030",
  "type": "OUTGOING_PAYMENT"
}
```

<Note>
  Bitcoin transfers to Spark wallets typically complete within seconds, much faster than traditional Bitcoin on-chain transactions.
</Note>

## Summary

You've successfully completed a Bitcoin purchase and transfer to a self-custody Spark wallet! Here's what happened:

1. ✅ Listed internal accounts and obtained USD funding instructions
2. ✅ Funded the internal account with USD via ACH
3. ✅ Created a customer via hosted KYC flow
4. ✅ Created and executed a quote to purchase Bitcoin and send to the Spark wallet

The customer now has 810 Satoshis in their self-custody Spark wallet!

## Next Steps

- **Transaction history**: Use `GET /transactions` to track all Bitcoin purchases
- **Price monitoring**: Build price alerts using the lookup endpoint to monitor rates
- **Webhook verification**: Implement signature verification for webhook security (see [Webhooks guide](/remittances/developer-guides/webhooks))
