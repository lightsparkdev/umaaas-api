description: "Complete walkthrough for buying Bitcoin and sending it as a reward to an external Spark wallet for self-custody"
---

This guide walks you through the complete process of buying Bitcoin with USD and sending it to a self-custody Spark wallet, from customer onboarding through quote execution.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, ensure you have:

- A Grid API account with valid authentication credentials
- Access to the Grid API endpoints (production or sandbox)
- A webhook endpoint configured to receive notifications
- A Spark wallet address where the Bitcoin will be sent

## Overview

The process consists of the following steps:

1. **List platform internal accounts** to find your platform's USD funding instructions
3. **Fund your internal account** via ACH push and receive a webhook notification
2. **Create a customer** using the hosted KYC/KYB link flow
4. **Add a Spark wallet** as an external account
5. **Create a quote** to lock in the BTC/USD exchange rate
6. **Execute the quote** to complete the Bitcoin purchase and transfer

## Step 1: List your platform's internal accounts

When your platform is first created, it is automatically assigned an internal account with a balance in your configured fiat currency.
List your platform's internal accounts to see the available balances and funding instructions for USD.

### Request

```http
GET /platform/internal-accounts?currency=USD
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

### Response

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "id": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
      "balance": {
        "amount": 0,
        "currency": {
          "code": "USD",
          "name": "United States Dollar",
          "symbol": "$",
          "decimals": 2
        }
      },
      "fundingPaymentInstructions": [
        {
          "reference": "FUND-BTC123",
          "instructionsNotes": "Include the reference code in your ACH transfer memo",
          "bankAccountInfo": {
            "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
            "accountNumber": "9876543210",
            "routingNumber": "021000021",
            "accountHolderName": "Lightspark Grid FBO John Doe",
            "bankName": "JP Morgan Chase"
          }
        },
        {
          "accountType": "SPARK_WALLET",
          "asset": "USDB",
          "address": "sprt1pgssyuuuhnrrdjswal5c3s3rafw9w3y5dd4cjy3duxlf7hjzkp0rqx6dj6mrhu",
          "invoice": "lnbc15u1p3xnhl2pp5jptserfk3zk4qy42tlucycrfwxhydvlemu9pqr93tuzlv9cc7g3sdqsvfhkcap3xyhx7un8cqzpgxqzjcsp5f8c52y2stc300gl6s4xswtjpc37hrnnr3c9wvtgjfuvqmpm35evq9qyyssqy4lgd8tj637qcjp05rdpxxykjenthxftej7a2zzmwrmrl70fyj9hvj0rewhzj7jfyuwkwcg9g2jpwtk3wkjtwnkdks84hsnu8xps5vsq4gj5hs"
        }
      ],
      "createdAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
}
```

The `fundingPaymentInstructions` provide the bank account details and reference code needed to fund this internal account via ACH pull from the customer's bank.

<Note>
  You can also see that there are Spark wallet funding instructions in this example response which can be used to fund the internal account with USDB instantly.
</Note>

## Step 2: Fund your Internal Account

You can initiate an ACH transfer from your bank to the account details provided in the funding instructions, making sure to include the reference code `FUND-BTC123` in the transfer memo.

<Note>
  In sandbox mode, you can use the `/sandbox/receive` endpoint to simulate receiving funds. In production, actual ACH transfers typically take 1-3 business days to settle.
</Note>

### Webhook Notification

When the funds are received and the internal account balance is updated, you'll receive a webhook notification:

```json
{
  "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
  "oldBalance": {
    "amount": 0,
    "currency": {
      "code": "USD",
      "name": "United States Dollar",
      "symbol": "$",
      "decimals": 2
    }
  },
  "newBalance": {
    "amount": 200000,
    "currency": {
      "code": "USD",
      "name": "United States Dollar",
      "symbol": "$",
      "decimals": 2
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020",
  "type": "ACCOUNT_STATUS"
}
```

The internal account now has a balance of $2,000.00 (200000 cents). You can use this balance to instantly distribute Bitcoin rewards to your customers.

## Step 3: Create a Customer with KYC/KYB Link

First, generate a hosted KYC/KYB link that your customer can use to complete their onboarding. This link provides a secure, hosted flow where the customer can submit their information.

### Request

```http
GET /customers/kyc-link?redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/onboarding-complete
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

### Response

```json
{
  "kycUrl": "https://kyc.lightspark.com/onboard/abc123def456"
}
```

The customer should be redirected to this URL to complete their KYC information. Once completed, they'll be redirected to your specified `redirect_uri`.

After the customer completes KYC, Grid will create their customer account and automatically provision internal accounts based on your platform configuration. You'll receive the customer ID through your onboarding flow.

For this example, let's assume the customer ID is: `Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001`

## Step 4: Add a Spark Wallet as External Account

Now add the customer's Spark wallet as an external account where the Bitcoin will be sent when the quote is executed.

### Request

```http
POST /external-accounts
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "currency": "BTC",
  "beneficiary": {
    "counterPartyType": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "fullName": "John Doe",
    "birthDate": "1990-01-15",
    "nationality": "US"
  },
  "accountInfo": {
    "accountType": "SPARK_WALLET",
    "address": "spark1pgssyuuuhnrrdjswal5c3s3rafw9w3y5dd4cjy3duxlf7hjzkp0rqx6dj6mrhu"
  }
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "ExternalAccount:b23dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d456",
  "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "beneficiary": {
    "counterPartyType": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "fullName": "John Doe",
    "birthDate": "1990-01-15",
    "nationality": "US"
  },
  "accountInfo": {
    "accountType": "SPARK_WALLET",
    "address": "spark1pgssyuuuhnrrdjswal5c3s3rafw9w3y5dd4cjy3duxlf7hjzkp0rqx6dj6mrhu"
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Create a Quote

Create a quote to lock in the BTC/USD exchange rate, fees, and get the final transfer details.

### Request

```http
POST /quotes
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:b23dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d456",
    "currency": "BTC"
  },
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 100,
  "description": "Bitcoin purchase for self-custody"
}
```

<Note>
  **Amount Locking**: You can lock either the USD amount you want to spend (`SENDING`) or the BTC amount you want to receive (`RECEIVING`). In this example, we're locking the sending amount to exactly $1.00 USD (100 cents).
</Note>

### Response

```json
{
  "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-03T15:05:00Z",
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:b23dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d456",
    "currency": "BTC"
  },
  "sendingCurrency": {
    "code": "USD",
    "name": "United States Dollar",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "receivingCurrency": {
    "code": "BTC",
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "symbol": "₿",
    "decimals": 8
  },
  "totalSendingAmount": 100,
  "totalReceivingAmount": 810,
  "exchangeRate": 8.1,
  "feesIncluded": 5,
  "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025"
}
```

The quote shows:
- **Sending**: \$1.00 USD (including $0.05 fee)
- **Receiving**: 0.0000081 BTC (810 satoshis)
- **Exchange rate**: 8.1 sats per USD cent (~$123,000 per BTC)
- **Quote expires**: In 5 minutes

<Warning>
  Bitcoin prices are volatile. Quotes typically expire in 1-5 minutes to protect against rapid price changes. Make sure to execute the quote before the `expiresAt` timestamp, or you'll need to create a new quote with updated rates.
</Warning>

## Step 6: Execute the Quote

Execute the quote to initiate the Bitcoin purchase and transfer to the Spark wallet.

### Request

```http
POST /quotes/Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020/execute
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

### Response

```json
{
  "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020",
  "status": "PROCESSING",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-03T15:05:00Z",
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:b23dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d456",
    "currency": "BTC"
  },
  "sendingCurrency": {
    "code": "USD",
    "name": "United States Dollar",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "receivingCurrency": {
    "code": "BTC",
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "symbol": "₿",
    "decimals": 8
  },
  "totalSendingAmount": 100,
  "totalReceivingAmount": 810,
  "exchangeRate": 8.1,
  "feesIncluded": 5,
  "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025"
}
```

The quote status changes to `PROCESSING` and the Bitcoin transfer is initiated. The USD is debited from the internal account, Bitcoin is purchased, and then sent to the Spark wallet address.

You can track the status by:
1. Polling the quote endpoint: `GET /quotes/{quoteId}`
2. Waiting for a webhook notification

### Completion Webhook

When the Bitcoin transfer completes, you'll receive a webhook notification:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "id": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "OUTGOING",
    "sentAmount": {
      "amount": 100,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 810,
      "currency": {
        "code": "BTC",
        "name": "Bitcoin",
        "symbol": "₿",
        "decimals": 8
      }
    },
    "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "settledAt": "2025-10-03T15:01:45Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
    "description": "Bitcoin purchase for self-custody",
    "exchangeRate": 8.1,
    "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T15:02:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000030",
  "type": "OUTGOING_PAYMENT"
}
```

<Note>
  Bitcoin transfers to Spark wallets typically complete within seconds, much faster than traditional Bitcoin on-chain transactions.
</Note>
