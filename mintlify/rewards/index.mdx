    Your platform's internal account is pre-funded with fiat currency (e.g., USD) via standard payment rails like ACH push.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Onboarding">
    Your user is onboarded via a secure, hosted KYC flow to meet compliance requirements before they can receive a reward.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Quote & Execution">
    You execute a single API call to create a quote, instantly convert a specific USD amount to BTC at the current market rate, and transfer the Bitcoin to the user's wallet address.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API">
    Programmatic access to onboard customers, fund your platform account, get quotes for Bitcoin purchases, and execute reward payouts. Reconcile all activity with real-time webhooks.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    Your development and operations team can use the dashboard to monitor balances and transactions, manage API keys and environments, and troubleshoot with detailed logs.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Onboarding Customers

<Info>
**Grid Rewards** has two customer onboarding options—one for non-regulated entities where Lightspark handles the KYC/KYB process via a hosted flow, and one for regulated entities where you handle the KYC/KYB process and can create users directly via the API.
</Info>

### Funding Your Platform Account

**Grid Rewards** operates on a pre-funded model. You can fund your internal platform account using several payment rails such as ACH, wire transfers, Lightning, and more. This stored balance is then used to instantly purchase and send Bitcoin rewards to your customers.

### Sending Rewards

To send a reward with **Grid Rewards**, you create and execute a quote. The API call specifies your funded internal account as the source and the customer's Bitcoin wallet address as the destination. Grid handles the USD-to-BTC conversion and instant delivery to the receiving wallet, notifying you of the completed transfer via webhook.

### Environments

<Note>
**Grid Rewards** supports two environments: **Sandbox** and **Production**. 

The Sandbox mirrors production behavior, allowing you to test the full end-to-end flow—from funding a test account and onboarding a mock customer to sending a simulated Bitcoin reward—without moving real funds. 

The Production environment uses live credentials and base URLs for real transactions once you're ready to launch.
