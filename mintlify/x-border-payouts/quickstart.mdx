description: "Complete guide for sending cross-border payments from basic bank transfers to advanced multi-currency scenarios across different customer types"
---

This comprehensive guide covers cross-border payments from basic examples to advanced multi-currency scenarios. Learn how to enable payments across fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins for different customer types using the Grid API.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, ensure you have:

- A Grid API account with valid authentication credentials
- Access to the Grid API endpoints (production or sandbox)
- A webhook endpoint configured to receive notifications
- Understanding of your customer type and compliance requirements

## Overview

Cross-border payments enable transfers between different currencies using real-time exchange rates. The Grid API supports:

- **Fiat currencies**: USD (primary), with support for other currencies as external accounts
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other major cryptocurrencies  
- **Stablecoins**: USDC, USDT, and other USD-pegged stablecoins

### Funding Account Types

- **Internal Accounts**: USD-only accounts managed by Grid, funded via ACH pull
- **External Accounts**: Multi-currency accounts supporting various asset types including fiat, crypto, and stablecoins

## Basic Example: Send to Foreign Bank Account

This example walks through the complete process of sending funds to an external bank account, from customer onboarding through quote execution.

### Step 1: Create a Customer with KYC Link

First, generate a hosted KYC link that your customer can use to complete their onboarding. This link provides a secure, hosted flow where the customer can submit their information.

```http
GET /customers/kyc-link?redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/onboarding-complete
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "kycUrl": "https://kyc.lightspark.com/onboard/abc123def456"
}
```

The customer should be redirected to this URL to complete their KYC information. Once completed, they'll be redirected to your specified `redirect_uri`.

After the customer completes KYC, Grid will create their customer account and automatically provision internal accounts based on your platform configuration. You'll receive the customer ID through your onboarding flow.

For this example, let's assume the customer ID is: `Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001`

### Step 2: List Internal Accounts

Once the customer is created, list their internal accounts to see the available balances and funding instructions.

```http
GET /internal-account?customerId=Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
      "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
      "balance": {
        "amount": 0,
        "currency": {
          "code": "USD",
          "name": "United States Dollar",
          "symbol": "$",
          "decimals": 2
        }
      },
      "fundingPaymentInstructions": [
        {
          "reference": "FUND-ABC123",
          "instructionsNotes": "Include the reference code in your ACH transfer memo",
          "bankAccountInfo": {
            "accountType": "US_ACCOUNT",
            "accountNumber": "9876543210",
            "routingNumber": "021000021",
            "accountHolderName": "Lightspark Grid FBO John Doe",
            "bankName": "JP Morgan Chase"
          }
        }
      ],
      "createdAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "hasMore": false,
  "totalCount": 1
}
```

The `fundingPaymentInstructions` provide the bank account details and reference code needed to fund this internal account via ACH pull from the customer's bank.

### Step 3: Fund the Internal Account

Your customer initiates an ACH transfer from their bank to the account details provided in the funding instructions, making sure to include the reference code `FUND-ABC123` in the transfer memo.

<Note>
  In sandbox mode, you can use the `/sandbox/receive` endpoint to simulate receiving funds. In production, actual ACH transfers typically take 1-3 business days to settle.
</Note>

**Webhook Notification:**
```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "id": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000010",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "INCOMING",
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 100000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "settledAt": "2025-10-03T14:30:00Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-03T14:25:00Z",
    "description": "Internal account funding"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000020",
  "type": "INCOMING_PAYMENT"
}
```

The internal account now has a balance of $1,000.00 (100000 cents).

### Step 4: Add an External Bank Account

Now add the destination bank account where you want to send the funds. In this example, we'll add a Mexican CLABE account.

```http
POST /external-accounts
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "currency": "MXN",
  "beneficiary": {
    "counterPartyType": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "fullName": "Maria Garcia",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
    "nationality": "MX"
  },
  "accountInfo": {
    "accountType": "CLABE",
    "clabeNumber": "123456789012345678",
    "bankName": "BBVA Mexico",
    "accountHolderName": "Maria Garcia"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
  "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "beneficiary": {
    "counterPartyType": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "fullName": "Maria Garcia",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
    "nationality": "MX"
  },
  "accountInfo": {
    "accountType": "CLABE",
    "clabeNumber": "123456789012345678",
    "bankName": "BBVA Mexico",
    "accountHolderName": "Maria Garcia"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Look Up the External Account

Before creating a quote, look up the external account to verify supported currencies and get estimated exchange rates.

```http
GET /receiver/external-account/ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123?customerId=Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
  "supportedCurrencies": [
    {
      "currency": {
        "code": "MXN",
        "name": "Mexican Peso",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      },
      "estimatedExchangeRate": 17.25,
      "min": 1000,
      "max": 1000000
    }
  ],
  "lookupId": "LookupRequest:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000009"
}
```

This shows you can send MXN to this account, with an estimated exchange rate of 17.25 MXN per 1 USD. The minimum send amount is 10.00 MXN and maximum is 10,000.00 MXN.

### Step 6: Create a Quote

Create a quote to lock in the exchange rate, fees, and get the final transfer details.

```http
POST /quotes
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "lookupId": "LookupRequest:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000009",
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
    "currency": "MXN"
  },
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 50000,
  "description": "Payment to Maria Garcia for services"
}
```

<Note>
  **Amount Locking**: You can lock either the sending amount (`SENDING`) or receiving amount (`RECEIVING`). In this example, we're locking the sending amount to exactly $500.00 USD (50000 cents).
</Note>

**Response:**
```json
{
  "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-03T15:05:00Z",
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
    "currency": "MXN"
  },
  "sendingCurrency": {
    "code": "USD",
    "name": "United States Dollar",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "receivingCurrency": {
    "code": "MXN",
    "name": "Mexican Peso",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "totalSendingAmount": 50000,
  "totalReceivingAmount": 861250,
  "exchangeRate": 17.25,
  "feesIncluded": 250,
  "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000015"
}
```

The quote shows:
- **Sending**: $500.00 USD (including $2.50 fee)
- **Receiving**: $8,612.50 MXN
- **Exchange rate**: 17.25 MXN per USD
- **Quote expires**: In 5 minutes

<Warning>
  Quotes typically expire in 1-5 minutes. Make sure to execute the quote before the `expiresAt` timestamp, or you'll need to create a new quote.
</Warning>

### Step 7: Execute the Quote

Execute the quote to initiate the transfer from the internal account to the external bank account.

```http
POST /quotes/Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006/execute
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006",
  "status": "PROCESSING",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T15:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-03T15:05:00Z",
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123",
    "currency": "MXN"
  },
  "sendingCurrency": {
    "code": "USD",
    "name": "United States Dollar",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "receivingCurrency": {
    "code": "MXN",
    "name": "Mexican Peso",
    "symbol": "$",
    "decimals": 2
  },
  "totalSendingAmount": 50000,
  "totalReceivingAmount": 861250,
  "exchangeRate": 17.25,
  "feesIncluded": 250,
  "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000015"
}
```

The quote status changes to `PROCESSING` and the transfer is initiated. You can track the status by:
1. Polling the quote endpoint: `GET /quotes/{quoteId}`
2. Waiting for a webhook notification

**Completion Webhook:**
```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "id": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000015",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "OUTGOING",
    "sentAmount": {
      "amount": 50000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 861250,
      "currency": {
        "code": "MXN",
        "name": "Mexican Peso",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "settledAt": "2025-10-03T15:02:30Z",

    "exchangeRate": 17.25,
    "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T15:03:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000025",
  "type": "OUTGOING_PAYMENT"
}
```

## Advanced: Cross-Currency Transfers

This advanced flow follows the same overall steps as the basic example, with options to fund from an internal USD account or an external multi-currency account, and to send to fiat, crypto, or stablecoin destinations.

### Step 1: Create or Identify the Customer

Use the same onboarding flow as the basic example (hosted KYC link), or reuse an existing `customerId` if the customer is already onboarded.

### Step 2: Prepare the Funding Source

- Internal funding (USD-only): List internal accounts and fund via ACH as shown in the basic example (Steps 2–3).  
- External funding (multi-currency): Use an existing external source account ID.

### Step 3: Add the Destination Account (Fiat, Crypto, or Stablecoin)

Add the external destination account in the desired currency/asset.

```http
POST /external-accounts
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "beneficiary": {
    "counterPartyType": "BUSINESS",
    "legalName": "European Partners GmbH"
  },
  "accountInfo": {
    "accountType": "IBAN",
    "ibanNumber": "DE89370400440532013000",
    "bankName": "Deutsche Bank",
    "accountHolderName": "European Partners GmbH"
  }
}
```

Crypto and stablecoin examples:

```json
{
  "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "currency": "BTC",
  "beneficiary": { "counterPartyType": "BUSINESS", "legalName": "Crypto Exchange Ltd" },
  "accountInfo": { "accountType": "SPARK_WALLET", "address": "sprt1pg...mrhu" }
}
```

```json
{
  "customerId": "Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "beneficiary": { "counterPartyType": "BUSINESS", "legalName": "Stablecoin Gateway Inc" },
  "accountInfo": { "accountType": "SPARK_WALLET", "address": "sprt1pg...mrhu" }
}
```

### Step 4: Look Up the Destination (Rates and Limits)

```http
GET /receiver/external-account/ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123?customerId=Customer:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

Use the response to confirm supported currencies, min/max limits, and estimated exchange rates.

### Step 5: Create a Quote (Choose Funding Source)

Option A — Internal USD account funding:

```http
POST /quotes
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "source": { "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965" },
  "destination": { "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123", "currency": "EUR" },
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 100000,
  "description": "Cross-currency transfer"
}
```

Option B — External account funding (multi-currency):

```http
POST /quotes
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "source": { "accountId": "ExternalAccount:source_account_123" },
  "destination": { "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d123", "currency": "EUR" },
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 100000,
  "description": "Cross-currency transfer from external account"
}
```

Option C — Crypto/stablecoin destination (either funding source):

```json
{
  "source": { "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965" },
  "destination": { "accountId": "ExternalAccount:crypto_destination_account", "currency": "BTC" },
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 1000000,
  "description": "USD to BTC"
}
```

### Step 6: Execute the Quote

Execute the quote using:

```http
POST /quotes/{quoteId}/execute
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

### Step 7: Monitor Completion via Webhooks

Monitor status via the OUTGOING_PAYMENT webhook, as shown in the basic example.

Create a quote for stablecoin transfer using internal account funding:

```http
POST /quotes
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "source": {
    "accountId": "InternalAccount:e85dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d965"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:a12dcbd6-dced-4ec4-b756-3c3a9ea3d127",
    "currency": "USDC"
  },
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 500000,
  "description": "USD to USDC stablecoin transfer"
}
```

**Alternative: External Account to Stablecoin Transfer**

Fund stablecoin transfers from external accounts:

```http
POST /quotes
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "source": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:external_funding_account"
  },
  "destination": {
    "accountId": "ExternalAccount:stablecoin_destination",
    "currency": "USDC"
  },
  "lockedCurrencySide": "SENDING",
  "lockedCurrencyAmount": 500000,
  "description": "External account to USDC stablecoin transfer"
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Currency Selection
- **USD (Internal Accounts)**: Primary fiat currency for traditional business payments
- **Multi-currency (External Accounts)**: Support for various fiat, crypto, and stablecoin currencies
- **Stablecoins**: Ideal for faster settlements and lower fees
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Suitable for tech-savvy businesses and international transfers

### 2. Exchange Rate Management
- Always check current rates before creating quotes
- Consider quote expiration times (typically 1-5 minutes)
- Use internal accounts for USD funding or external accounts for multi-currency funding

### 3. Compliance Considerations
- Ensure proper KYB/KYC verification for each customer type
- Maintain audit trails for all cross-border transactions
- Implement proper webhook signature verification
- Support both business-to-business and business-to-individual payment flows

### 4. Error Handling
- Monitor quote status and handle failures gracefully
- Implement proper retry mechanisms for failed transfers
- Use webhooks for real-time status updates
- Handle both internal and external account funding scenarios
