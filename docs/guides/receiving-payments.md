# Receiving Payments

This guide outlines the process for platforms to receive payments from UMA addresses.

## Step 1: Platform configuration (one-time setup)

Configure your platform settings (if you haven't already in the onboarding process), including the required counterparty information.

```http
PUT /config
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "umaDomain": "mycompany.com",
  "webhookEndpoint": "https://api.mycompany.com/webhooks/uma",
  "requiredCounterpartyFields": [
    {
      "name": "FULL_NAME",
      "mandatory": true
    },
    {
      "name": "DATE_OF_BIRTH",
      "mandatory": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 2: Register users with bank account information

First, register your users in the system so they can receive payments via UMA.

```http
POST /users
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "umaAddress": "$john.sender@uma.domain.com",
  "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
  "userType": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "fullName": "John Sender",
  "dateOfBirth": "1985-06-15",
  "address": {
    "line1": "123 Pine Street",
    "line2": "Unit 501",
    "city": "Mexico City",
    "state": "Mexico City",
    "postalCode": "01000",
    "country": "MX"
  },
  "bankAccountInfo": {
    "accountType": "CLABE",
    "accountNumber": "123456789012345678",
    "bankName": "Banco de MÃ©xico"
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Webhook setup (one-time setup)

Configure your webhook endpoints to receive notifications about incoming payments. You'll need to implement the webhook endpoints on your server. Remember to validate webhook signatures to ensure they are authentic.

## Step 4: Receive and approve incoming payments

When someone initiates a payment to one of your users' UMA addresses, you'll receive a webhook call with a pending transaction:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000005",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "type": "INCOMING",
    "senderUmaAddress": "$sender@external.domain",
    "receiverUmaAddress": "$recipient@uma.domain",
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 50000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "userId": "User:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
    "counterpartyInformation": {
      "fullName": "John Sender",
      "dateOfBirth": "1985-06-15"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000007",
  "type": "INCOMING_PAYMENT"
}
```

To approve the payment, respond with a 200 OK status.

To reject the payment, respond with a 400 Bad Request status and a JSON body with the following fields:

```json
{
  "code": "payment_rejected",
  "message": "Payment rejected due to compliance policy",
  "details": {
    "reason": "failed_counterparty_check",
    "rejectionReason": "User is in a restricted jurisdiction"
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Receive completion notification

When the payment completes, your webhook endpoint will receive another notification:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000005",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "INCOMING",
    "senderUmaAddress": "$sender@external.domain",
    "receiverUmaAddress": "$recipient@uma.domain",
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 50000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "userId": "User:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
    "settlementTime": "2023-08-15T14:30:00Z",
    "createdAt": "2023-08-15T14:25:18Z",
    "description": "Payment for services",
    "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000007",
  "type": "INCOMING_PAYMENT"
}
```
