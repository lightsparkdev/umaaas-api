# Receiving Payments

This guide outlines the process for platforms to receive payments from UMA addresses.

## Process Overview

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between your platform and the UMAaS API when receiving payments:

    participant Sender as External Sender
    participant UMAaS as UMAaS API
    participant Client as Your Platform
    participant Bank as Banking Provider
    
    Note over Client, UMAaS: One-time setup
    Client->>UMAaS: PUT /config (set domain, webhook URL)
    UMAaS-->>Client: Configuration saved
    Client->>UMAaS: POST /users (register users with bank info)
    UMAaS-->>Client: User registered
    
    Note over Sender, UMAaS: Payment initiated by sender
    Sender->>UMAaS: Initiates payment to UMA address
    UMAaS->>Client: Webhook: INCOMING_PAYMENT (PENDING)
    
    alt Payment approved
        Client-->>UMAaS: HTTP 200 OK (approve payment)
        UMAaS->>Bank: Execute payment to user's bank account
        UMAaS->>Client: Webhook: INCOMING_PAYMENT (COMPLETED)
        Client-->>UMAaS: HTTP 200 OK (acknowledge completion)
    else Payment rejected
        Client-->>UMAaS: HTTP 400 Bad Request with rejection reason
        UMAaS->>Sender: Payment rejected notification
    end
```

The process consists of five main steps:

1. **Platform configuration** (one-time setup) to set your UMA domain and required counterparty fields
2. **Register users** with their bank account information so they can receive payments
3. **Set up webhook endpoints** to receive notifications about incoming payments
4. **Receive and approve/reject incoming payments** via webhooks
5. **Receive completion notification** when the payment completes

## Step 1: Platform configuration (one-time setup)

Configure your platform settings (if you haven't already in the onboarding process), including the required counterparty information.

```http
PUT /config
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "umaDomain": "mycompany.com",
  "webhookEndpoint": "https://api.mycompany.com/webhooks/uma",
  "requiredCounterpartyFields": [
    {
      "name": "FULL_NAME",
      "mandatory": true
    },
    {
      "name": "DATE_OF_BIRTH",
      "mandatory": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 2: Register users with bank account information

First, register your users in the system so they can receive payments via UMA.

```http
POST /users
```

Request body:

```json
{
  "umaAddress": "$john.sender@uma.domain.com",
  "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
  "userType": "INDIVIDUAL",
  "fullName": "John Sender",
  "dateOfBirth": "1985-06-15",
  "address": {
    "line1": "123 Pine Street",
    "line2": "Unit 501",
    "city": "Mexico City",
    "state": "Mexico City",
    "postalCode": "01000",
    "country": "MX"
  },
  "bankAccountInfo": {
    "accountType": "CLABE",
    "accountNumber": "123456789012345678",
    "bankName": "Banco de MÃ©xico"
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Webhook setup (one-time setup)

Configure your webhook endpoints to receive notifications about incoming payments. You'll need to implement the webhook endpoints on your server. Remember to validate webhook signatures to ensure they are authentic.

## Step 4: Receive and approve incoming payments

When someone initiates a payment to one of your users' UMA addresses, you'll receive a webhook call with a pending transaction:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000005",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "type": "INCOMING",
    "senderUmaAddress": "$sender@external.domain",
    "receiverUmaAddress": "$recipient@uma.domain",
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 50000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "userId": "User:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
    "counterpartyInformation": {
      "fullName": "John Sender",
      "dateOfBirth": "1985-06-15"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000007",
  "type": "INCOMING_PAYMENT"
}
```

To approve the payment, respond with a 200 OK status.

To reject the payment, respond with a 400 Bad Request status and a JSON body with the following fields:

```json
{
  "code": "payment_rejected",
  "message": "Payment rejected due to compliance policy",
  "details": {
    "reason": "failed_counterparty_check",
    "rejectionReason": "User is in a restricted jurisdiction"
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Receive completion notification

When the payment completes, your webhook endpoint will receive another notification:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "transactionId": "Transaction:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000005",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "type": "INCOMING",
    "senderUmaAddress": "$sender@external.domain",
    "receiverUmaAddress": "$recipient@uma.domain",
    "receivedAmount": {
      "amount": 50000,
      "currency": {
        "code": "USD",
        "name": "United States Dollar",
        "symbol": "$",
        "decimals": 2
      }
    },
    "userId": "User:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000001",
    "platformUserId": "9f84e0c2a72c4fa",
    "settlementTime": "2023-08-15T14:30:00Z",
    "createdAt": "2023-08-15T14:25:18Z",
    "description": "Payment for services",
    "quoteId": "Quote:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000006"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T14:32:00Z",
  "webhookId": "Webhook:019542f5-b3e7-1d02-0000-000000000007",
  "type": "INCOMING_PAYMENT"
}
```
