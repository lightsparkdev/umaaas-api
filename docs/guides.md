For most implementations, we recommend following these guides in order:

1. **Platform Configuration** - Set up your basic platform settings first
2. **Configuring Users** - Learn how to register users with their UMA addresses and bank accounts
3. **Webhook Verification** - Implement proper security for webhook handling
4. **Sending Payments** and/or **Receiving Payments** - Implement the payment flows relevant to your business

Each guide includes detailed API examples, sequence diagrams for visualizing the process flow, and best practices for implementation.
