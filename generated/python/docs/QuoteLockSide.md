# QuoteLockSide

The side of the quote which should be locked and specified in the `lockedCurrencyAmount`. For example, if I want to send exactly $5 MXN from my wallet, I would set this to \"sending\", and the `lockedCurrencyAmount` to 500 (in cents). If I want the receiver to receive exactly $10 USD, I would set this to \"receiving\" and the `lockedCurrencyAmount` to 10000 (in cents).

## Enum

* `SENDING` (value: `'SENDING'`)

* `RECEIVING` (value: `'RECEIVING'`)
