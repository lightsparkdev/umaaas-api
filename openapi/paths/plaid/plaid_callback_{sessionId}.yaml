  summary: Submit Plaid public token
  description: |
    After the user completes Plaid Link authentication, the platform should POST
    the public_token to this callback URL (provided in the link token response).

    This will trigger asynchronous processing:
    1. Lightspark exchanges the public_token for an access_token with Plaid
    2. Lightspark retrieves and verifies the account details
    3. An external account is created
    4. A webhook notification is sent to the platform when complete
