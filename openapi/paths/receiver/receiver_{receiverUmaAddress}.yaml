                type: enum
                description: >-
                  KYC status of the customer. This field describes whether the UMA provider
                  is doing a full KYC check on the customer. Note that in cases where the UMA provider
                  is proxying to an underlying bank account, the bank will still have KYC'd the customer.
                  See `bankAccountNameMatchingStatus` for cases where there's a backing bank account, but
                  the UMA provider is able to verify the account holder's name.
                example: VERIFIED
                enum:
                  - UNKNOWN
                  - NOT_VERIFIED
                  - PENDING
                  - VERIFIED
              bankAccountNameMatchingStatus:
                type: enum
                description: >-
                  Status of the bank account name matching. This field describes whether the UMA provider
                  is able to verify that a backing bank account holder's name matches the name provided
                  as payee data in the payreq response if applicable. It ensures that the ultimate landing
                  destination of the payment is the intended payee. Note that this field is only applicable if the
                  UMA provider is proxying to an underlying bank account.
                example: MATCHED
                enum:
                  - UNKNOWN
                  - NOT_MATCHED
