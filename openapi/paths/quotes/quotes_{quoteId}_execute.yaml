  summary: Execute a quote
  description: |
    Execute a quote by its ID. This endpoint initiates the transfer between
    the source and destination accounts.

    This endpoint can only be used for quotes with a `source` which is either an internal account,
    or has direct pull functionality (e.g. ACH pull with an external account).

    Once executed, the quote cannot be cancelled and the transfer will be processed.
