  summary: Create a transfer quote
  description: |
    Generate a quote for a cross-currency transfer between any combination of accounts
    and UMA addresses. This endpoint handles currency exchange and provides the necessary
    instructions to execute the transfer.

    **Transfer Types Supported:**
    - **Account to Account**: Transfer between internal/external accounts with currency exchange.
    - **Account to UMA**: Transfer from an internal account to an UMA address.
    - **UMA to Account or UMA to UMA**: This transfer type will only be funded by payment instructions, not from an internal account.

    **Key Features:**
    - **Flexible Amount Locking**: Always specify whether you want to lock the sending amount or receiving amount
    - **Currency Exchange**: Handles all cross-currency transfers with real-time exchange rates
    - **Payment Instructions**: For UMA or customer ID sources, provides banking details needed for execution

    **Important:** If you are transferring funds in the same currency (no exchange required),
    use the `/transfer-in` or `/transfer-out` endpoints instead.
