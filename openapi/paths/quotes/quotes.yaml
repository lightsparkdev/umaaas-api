  summary: Create a payment quote
  description: >
    Generate a quote for a payment from one UMA address to another.

    The quote locks in exchange rates and fees for a set period of time and
    provides

    payment instructions that can be used to execute the payment.


    Depending on the `lockedCurrencySide` parameter, either the sending amount
    or 

    receiving amount will be locked.


    The returned quote includes payment instructions with the banking details

    needed to execute the payment and fulfill the quote. These instructions

    must be followed precisely, including any reference codes provided.
