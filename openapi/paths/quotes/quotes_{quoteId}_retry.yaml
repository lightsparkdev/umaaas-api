  summary: Retry an incomplete payment
  description: >
    In the case where a customer is debited but the Lightning payment fails to complete, integrators can retry the payment using this endpoint.  


    Payments retried with this endpoint will debit from the sender and deliver to the recipient the same amount as the original quote.

    As UMA as a service does not persist customer PII, retries need to start with a lookup request to retrieve the original quote's recipient counter party data requirements then pass that sender information in the request body.

    Before calling this endpoint, you should reach out to the UMA as a service team to investigate the underlying issue.  As part of resolution, they'll update the transaction to the appropriate state.  The quote / transaction to retry must be in a `FAILED` or `REFUNDED` state.
