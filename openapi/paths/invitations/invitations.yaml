              description: >
                An amount to send (in the smallest unit of the customer's currency)
                to the invitee when the invitation is claimed.

                This is optional and if not provided, the invitee will not
                receive any amount. Note that the actual sending of

                the amount must be done by the inviter platform once the
                INVITATION_CLAIMED webhook is received. If the inviter

                platform either does not send the payment or the payment fails,
                the invitee will not receive this amount. This

                field is primarily used for display purposes on the claiming
                side of the invitation.
              type: integer
              format: int64
