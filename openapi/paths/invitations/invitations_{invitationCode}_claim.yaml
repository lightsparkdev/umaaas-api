  description: >
    Claim an UMA invitation by associating it with an invitee UMA address.


    When an invitation is successfully claimed:

    1. The invitation status changes from PENDING to CLAIMED

    2. The invitee UMA address is associated with the invitation

    3. An INVITATION_CLAIMED webhook is triggered to notify the platform that
    created the invitation


    This endpoint allows customers to accept invitations sent to them by other UMA
    customers.
