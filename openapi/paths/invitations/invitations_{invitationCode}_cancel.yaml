  summary: Cancel an UMA invitation
  description: >
    Cancel a pending UMA invitation. Only the inviter or platform can cancel an
    invitation.


    When an invitation is cancelled:

    1. The invitation status changes from PENDING to CANCELLED

    2. The invitation can no longer be claimed

    3. The invitation URL will show as cancelled when accessed


    Only pending invitations can be cancelled. Attempting to cancel an
    invitation

    that is already claimed, expired, or cancelled will result in an error.
