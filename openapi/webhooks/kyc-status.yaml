  summary: KYC customer status change
  description: >
    Webhook that is called when the KYC status of a customer is updated.

    This endpoint should be implemented by clients of the Grid API.


    ### Authentication

    The webhook includes a signature in the `X-Grid-Signature` header that
    allows you to verify that the webhook was sent by Grid.

    To verify the signature:

    1. Get the Grid API public key provided to you during integration

    2. Decode the base64 signature from the header

    3. Create a SHA-256 hash of the request body

    4. Verify the signature using the public key and the hash


    If the signature verification succeeds, the webhook is authentic. If not, it
    should be rejected.


    ### KYC/B Flow

    This webhook is triggered when KYC/B has reached a decision on a customer. Generally most customers will finish KYC within a few minutes.
    Others might be rejected because of incorrect data passed in or may have been flagged for manual review.

    The webhook will only trigger for final states. This will be APPROVED, REJECTED, EXPIRED, CANCELED, MANUALLY_APPROVED, MANUALLY_REJECTED.

      * APPROVED: The customer has been approved.
      * REJECTED: The customer has been rejected after a KYC check.
      * PENDING_REVIEW: KYC check is in progress.
      * EXPIRED: KYC check has expired. This is generally because a customer did not submit all required information needed within a session.
      * CANCELED: KYC check was canceled.
      * MANUALLY_APPROVED: The customer was manually approved.
      * MANUALLY_REJECTED: The customer was manually rejected.
      * NOT_STARTED: KYC has not started on the customer.
