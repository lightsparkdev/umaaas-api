  summary: Account status notification webhook
  description: >
    Webhook that is called when the balance of an account changes

    This endpoint should be implemented by clients of the Grid API.


    ### Authentication

    The webhook includes a signature in the `X-Grid-Signature` header that
    allows you to verify that the webhook was sent by Grid.

    To verify the signature:

    1. Get the Grid public key provided to you during integration

    2. Decode the base64 signature from the header

    3. Create a SHA-256 hash of the request body

    4. Verify the signature using the public key and the hash


    If the signature verification succeeds, the webhook is authentic. If not, it
    should be rejected.


    ### Account status

    When the balance of an internal account changes, we will push a notification with information on the account, the new
    balance, and who the account belongs to.
