  summary: Incoming payment webhook and approval mechanism
  description: >
    Webhook that is called when an incoming payment is received by a customer's UMA
    address.

    This endpoint should be implemented by clients of the Grid API.


    ### Authentication

    The webhook includes a signature in the `X-Grid-Signature` header that
    allows you to verify that the webhook was sent by Grid.

    To verify the signature:

    1. Get the Grid public key provided to you during integration

    2. Decode the base64 signature from the header

    3. Create a SHA-256 hash of the request body

    4. Verify the signature using the public key and the hash


    If the signature verification succeeds, the webhook is authentic. If not, it
    should be rejected.


    ### Payment Approval Flow

    When a transaction has `status: "PENDING"`, this webhook serves as an
    approval mechanism:


    1. The client should check the `counterpartyInformation` against their
    requirements

    2. To APPROVE the payment synchronously, return a 200 OK response

    3. To REJECT the payment, return a 403 Forbidden response with an Error
    object

    4. To request more information, return a 422 Unprocessable Entity with
    specific missing fields

    5. To process the payment asynchronously, return a 202 Accepted response and
    then call the `/transactions/{transactionId}/approve` or
    `/transactions/{transactionId}/reject` endpoint within 5 seconds. Note that
    synchronous approval/rejection is preferred where possible.


    The Grid system will proceed or cancel the payment based on your response.


    For transactions with other statuses (COMPLETED, FAILED, REFUNDED), this
    webhook is purely informational.

        Webhook received successfully.

        For PENDING transactions, this indicates approval to proceed with the
        payment.

        If `requestedReceiverCustomerInfoFields` were present in the webhook
        request, the corresponding fields for the recipient must be included in
        this response in the `receiverCustomerInfo` object.

        Webhook received and will be processed asynchronously. The synchronous
        200 response should be preferred where possible. This asycnhronous path
        should only be used in

        cases where the platform's architecture requires async (but still very
        quick) processing before approving or rejecting the payment.

        The platform must call the `/transactions/{transactionId}/approve` or
        `/transactions/{transactionId}/reject` endpoint to approve or reject the
        payment within 5 seconds or the payment will be automatically rejected.
