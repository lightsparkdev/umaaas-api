  summary: Invitation claimed webhook
  description: >
    Webhook that is called when an invitation is claimed by a customer.

    This endpoint should be implemented by platform clients of the Grid API.


    When a customer claims an invitation, this webhook is triggered to notify the
    platform that:

    1. The invitation has been successfully claimed

    2. The invitee UMA address is now associated with the invitation

    3. The invitation status has changed from PENDING to CLAIMED


    This allows platforms to:

    - Track invitation usage and conversion rates

    - Trigger onboarding flows for new customers who joined via invitation

    - Apply referral bonuses or rewards to the inviter

    - Update their UI to reflect the claimed status


    ### Authentication

    The webhook includes a signature in the `X-Grid-Signature` header that
    allows you to verify that the webhook was sent by Grid.

    To verify the signature:

    1. Get the Grid public key provided to you during integration

    2. Decode the base64 signature from the header

    3. Create a SHA-256 hash of the request body

    4. Verify the signature using the public key and the hash


    If the signature verification succeeds, the webhook is authentic. If not, it
    should be rejected.
