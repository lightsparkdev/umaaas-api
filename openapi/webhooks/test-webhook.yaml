  summary: Test webhook for integration verification
  description: >
    Webhook that is sent once to verify your webhook endpoint is correctly set
    up.

    This is sent when you configure or update your platform settings with a
    webhook URL.


    ### Authentication

    The webhook includes a signature in the `X-Grid-Signature` header that
    allows you to verify that the webhook was sent by the Grid API.

    To verify the signature:

    1. Get the Grid public key provided to you during integration

    2. Decode the base64 signature from the header

    3. Create a SHA-256 hash of the request body

    4. Verify the signature using the public key and the hash


    If the signature verification succeeds, the webhook is authentic. If not, it
    should be rejected.


    This webhook is purely for testing your endpoint integration and signature
    verification.
