  summary: Bulk upload status webhook
  description: >
    Webhook that is called when a bulk user upload job completes or fails.

    This endpoint should be implemented by clients of the UMAaas API.


    ### Authentication

    The webhook includes a signature in the `X-UMAaas-Signature` header that
    allows you to verify that the webhook was sent by UMAaas.

    To verify the signature:

    1. Get the UMAaas public key provided to you during integration

    2. Decode the base64 signature from the header

    3. Create a SHA-256 hash of the request body

    4. Verify the signature using the public key and the hash


    If the signature verification succeeds, the webhook is authentic. If not, it
    should be rejected.


    This webhook is sent when a bulk upload job completes or fails, providing
    detailed information about the results.
