    WebhookSignature:

      in: header
      name: X-Grid-Signature
      description: >
        Secp256r1 (P-256) asymmetric signature of the webhook payload, which can
        be used to verify that the webhook was sent by Grid.


        To verify the signature:

        1. Get the Grid public key provided to you during integration

        2. Decode the base64 signature from the header

        3. Create a SHA-256 hash of the request body

        4. Verify the signature using the public key and the hash


        If the signature verification succeeds, the webhook is authentic. If
        not, it should be rejected.
