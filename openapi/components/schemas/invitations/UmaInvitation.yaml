  amountToSend:
    $ref: ../common/CurrencyAmount.yaml
    description: >-
      The amount to send to the invitee when the invitation is claimed. This is
      optional and if not provided, the invitee will not receive any amount.
      Note that the actual sending of the amount must be done by the inviter
      platform once the INVITATION_CLAIMED webhook is received. If the inviter
      platform either does not send the payment or the payment fails, the
      invitee will not receive this amount. This field is primarily used for
      display purposes on the claiming side of the invitation.

      This field is useful for "send-by-link" style customer flows where an inviter
      can send a payment simply by sharing a link without knowing the receiver's
      UMA address. Note that these sends can only be sender-locked, meaning that
      the sender will not know ahead of time how much the receiver will receive
      in the receiving currency.
