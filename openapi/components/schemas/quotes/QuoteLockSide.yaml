  The side of the quote which should be locked and specified in the
  `lockedCurrencyAmount`. For example, if I want to send exactly $5 MXN from my
  wallet, I would set this to "sending", and the `lockedCurrencyAmount` to 500
  (in cents). If I want the receiver to receive exactly $10 USD, I would set
  this to "receiving" and the `lockedCurrencyAmount` to 10000 (in cents).
