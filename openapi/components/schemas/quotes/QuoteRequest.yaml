      Lookup ID from a previous receiver lookup request. If provided,
      this can make the quote creation more efficient by reusing cached lookup data.

      NOTE: This is required for UMA destinations due to counterparty institution requirements.

        description: >-
          A convenient destination option which adds the external account and creates
          the quote in one step rather than first needing to call /external-accounts

  immediatelyExecute:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Whether to immediately execute the quote after creation. If true,
      the quote will be executed and the transaction will be created at
      the current exchange rate. It should only be used if you don't want
      to lock and view rate details before executing the quote. If you are
      executing a pre-existing quote, use the `/quotes/{quoteId}/execute`
      endpoint instead. This is false by default.
